# Benchmark Harness

`benchmark/targets.toml` is the checked-in pinned corpus manifest for the `bifrost` benchmark harness.

The manifest is intentionally explicit. Each repo entry carries:

- the remote URL
- the exact pinned commit SHA
- the language slice this repo is meant to cover
- optional extension filters when the repo is multi-language
- the enabled benchmark scenarios
- the deterministic probe inputs those scenarios need

Current probe-input fields are:

- `search_patterns` for `search_symbols`
- `location_symbols` for `get_symbol_locations`
- `ancestor_symbols` for `get_symbol_ancestors`
- `summary_targets` for `get_summaries`
- `seed_file_paths` for `most_relevant_files`
- `usage_symbols` for `scan_usages`
- `[[repos.code_quality_probes]]` for every code-quality (SlopCop) scenario:
  `dead_code_smells`, `comment_density_files`, `comment_density_code_unit`,
  `exception_smells`, `test_assertion_smells`, `structural_clone_smells`,
  `long_method_smells`, `secret_like_code`, and `git_hotspots`
- `definition_queries` for `get_definition`

Each code-quality probe names its `scenario` plus the exact tool inputs and a
Markdown-report oracle. `file_paths` (required for every scenario except
`git_hotspots` and `comment_density_code_unit`) both feeds the tool and pins
those files for `--max-files` subset runs. `fq_names` carries symbol inputs:
exactly one for `comment_density_code_unit`, one or more for
`dead_code_smells`. `arguments` is an optional raw table merged over the
scenario's default tool payload, so per-tool tuning knobs (`min_score`,
`shingle_size`, `since_iso`, ...) never need new manifest fields.
`expect_report_contains` is mandatory and should quote a specific finding line
from the pinned repo, never generic header text an empty report also contains
-- a probe whose oracle accepts an empty report cannot distinguish a fast
regression that silently stopped finding anything. `expect_report_absent` pins
failure text that must not appear, such as unresolved-symbol skips or
unsupported-language placeholders. A repo that enables a code-quality scenario
must define at least one probe for it; a scenario with several probes issues
one tool call per probe inside each timed iteration.

`git_hotspots` probes on pinned repos must set `since_iso`/`until_iso` in
`arguments`: the tool's default window is relative to the current time, and a
pinned commit's history ages out of it. An explicit window bracketing the
pinned history keeps the churn report deterministic.

Code-quality coverage matrix: `comment_density_files`,
`comment_density_code_unit`, `long_method_smells`, and `git_hotspots` run on
all eleven corpus repos. `dead_code_smells` runs everywhere except fmt-cpp.
Exclusions are evidence-backed and enforced by the
`code_quality_scenarios_cover_the_expected_language_matrix` test in
`tests/suite_bench_policy/benchmark_manifest.rs`: Kotlin clone smells are
unimplemented (#1371); the express-js, fastroute-php, scala-xml, and (for
exceptions) fmt-cpp corpora have genuinely zero exception/test-assertion
findings even at min_score 1 -- fmt throws through FMT_THROW rather than
catch blocks -- so those scenarios are off there rather than pinned to an
empty report; only the java, javascript, cpp, and csharp repos have pinnable
secret-like findings (exposed-kotlin has real docker-compose password findings,
but the scan exceeds the MCP request budget on that multi-module workspace, so
the scenario is off there until the latency is fixed).
Ruby is intentionally absent from all scenarios because the pinned corpus
does not include a Ruby repo.

`definition_queries` entries are source-location probes. Each entry defines a
project-relative `path`, either `line` plus `column` or a byte range, optional
`symbol`, required `expected_status`, and optional `expected_fqn`. The benchmark
fails the `get_definition` scenario when the returned status differs or when an
expected FQN is not present in the returned definitions. Unsupported languages
should assert `unsupported_language` until first-class support is added.

Milestone 1 validation fails when any of these drift:

- the union of repo languages no longer covers every supported analyzer language from `README.md`
- the union of repo scenarios no longer covers the minimum smoke set
- a repo enables a scenario without the exact inputs that scenario needs

The initial corpus is kept small on purpose. It is meant to be stable enough for daily CI, not a clone of Brokk's much larger baseline suite.

`interactive-latency.toml` is a separate release-mode gate for common
code-intelligence requests against a pinned Bifrost checkout. Every case has a
5,000 ms warm-p95 budget and a correctness oracle. It covers batched symbol
search, exact source lookup, definition lookup, summaries, the exact and
line-only `SemanticProcedureSummary` usage scans from issue #1228, and an MCP
fairness case that overlaps a heavy scan with a lightweight source request.
Reports include p50 and p95 for every scenario and explicitly count measured
scan iterations that met the latency contract by returning a truthful bounded
incomplete result. `--profile` preserves the per-request queue, execution,
response-queue, and writer-delivery timing traces.

## Layout

Benchmark-local runtime artifacts stay under ignored directories:

- repo cache: `benchmark/.cache/repos`
- subset workspaces: `benchmark/.cache/repos/.subsets`
- JSON reports: `benchmark/benchmark-output`

The repo cache holds full clones. A blobless clone (`--filter=blob:none`) of a
network remote is not a valid fixture: `most_relevant_files` refuses the git
co-change history walk on such a clone (issue #1373), which silently changes
the measured code path to the import-only fallback. The harness upgrades a
cached partial clone in place with `git fetch --refetch` and removes the
promisor markers.

The important checked-in files in this directory are:

- `targets.toml`: pinned corpus, per-repo probes, and default local paths
- `interactive-latency.toml`: pinned Bifrost self-corpus with absolute latency budgets
- `README.md`: operator documentation for the harness and the planned daily workflow
- `get_definition_observations.md`: manually inspected definition-lookup probe results and follow-up notes
- `baselines/`: blessed compare targets and promotion notes for the scheduled workflow

## Local Use

Validate the checked-in corpus:

```bash
cargo run --bin bifrost_benchmark -- validate --manifest benchmark/targets.toml
```

Run one repo against the full pinned checkout:

```bash
cargo build --bin bifrost --bin bifrost_benchmark
./target/debug/bifrost_benchmark run --manifest benchmark/targets.toml --repo gin-go
```

Run the interactive latency gate in the same release configuration as CI:

```bash
scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh \
  scripts/run-interactive-latency.sh --profile
```

The harness verifies the MCP server's embedded build identity during
initialization and fails if either sibling binary is stale. Rebuild both
binaries after changing or updating the checkout.

For each `query_code` case, the harness first runs the correctness-checked
query in an untimed scan-only process to populate durable structural facts.
It then starts a fresh measured process, so first-request timings include
persisted hydration but exclude process-local facts, postings, and derived
layers. The report records hydration and extraction counters to verify that
cold contract.

For faster local iteration, `bifrost_benchmark run` also supports `--max-files N`:

```bash
cargo run --bin bifrost_benchmark -- run \
  --manifest benchmark/targets.toml \
  --repo gin-go \
  --max-files 100
```

That mode creates a deterministic subset workspace under the benchmark repo cache, pins the manifest's explicit probe files first, and preserves `.git` metadata so `most_relevant_files` keeps its git-churn relevance signal. It is intended for smoke-checking the harness itself, not for baseline-quality timing comparisons.

Compare a candidate report against the blessed baseline:

```bash
cargo run --bin bifrost_benchmark -- compare \
  --baseline benchmark/baselines/ubuntu-latest.json \
  --candidate benchmark/benchmark-output/run-20260604T130836Z.json \
  --output benchmark/benchmark-output/compare-local.json
```

Add `--strict` when you want the command to exit nonzero on regressions instead of only writing the compare JSON and human summary.

## Daily Harness Shape

The intended daily workflow contract is:

1. Run `bifrost_benchmark validate` against the checked-in manifest.
2. Run `bifrost_benchmark run` against the same manifest on `ubuntu-latest`.
3. Upload the JSON report artifact from `benchmark/benchmark-output`.
4. Compare that report against `benchmark/baselines/ubuntu-latest.json` when that blessed baseline exists.
5. Publish a short human-readable summary, with optional Slack notification, after the compare step.

The same workflow also runs the independent `interactive-latency` job. It
builds release binaries, executes the pinned Bifrost self-corpus with profiling
enabled, publishes a p50/p95 table, uploads all raw timing traces, and fails on
either an oracle failure or a warm-p95 budget violation.

The harness already guarantees two useful operator properties for that workflow:

- cached repos can be reused offline once the pinned commit is present locally
- failed scenarios still produce a written report before the CLI exits nonzero

The checked-in GitHub Actions workflow lives at `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`.

- Scheduled runs execute from the workflow cron at `17 9 * * *` on `ubuntu-latest`.
- Manual runs use `workflow_dispatch` and can optionally scope to one manifest repo and/or `--max-files`.
- Compare runs are strict only when `workflow_dispatch` sets `strict_compare = true`.
- If `benchmark/baselines/ubuntu-latest.json` is not present yet, the workflow uploads the run artifact and records that compare was skipped.

The manual workflow inputs are:

- `repo`: optional manifest repo name, for example `gin-go`
- `max_files`: optional subset cap for smoke runs, for example `100`
- `strict_compare`: when `true`, fail the workflow if the compare step finds regressions

## Slack Hook

The benchmark workflow can optionally trigger a Slack Workflow Builder webhook after the run summary is prepared.

GitHub-side setup:

- configure a repository secret named `SLACK_DAILY_PERF_WEBHOOK_URL`
- keep the webhook URL in that secret, not in a GitHub variable
- if the secret is absent, the workflow skips Slack delivery cleanly
- Slack delivery is best-effort only; webhook or Slack-side failures do not change the benchmark workflow outcome

The webhook payload is benchmark-specific. The workflow sends these fields:

- `ok`
- `error_text`
- `workflow_run_url`
- `head_sha_short`
- `base_sha_short`
- `event_name`
- `repo_input`
- `max_files_input`
- `strict_compare`
- `run_outcome`
- `compare_outcome`
- `report_path`
- `compare_path`
- `compare_summary_path`
- `generated_at`
- `selected_repo`
- `report_max_files`
- `repo_count`
- `failed_scenarios_count`
- `compared_scenarios_count`
- `regression_count`
- `actionable_regression_count`
- `improvement_count`
- `missing_candidate_count`
- `new_candidate_count`
- `has_regressions`
- `has_actionable_regressions`
- `environment_variance_detected`
- `environment_variance_detail`
- `environment_variance_covered_regression_count`
- `environment_variance_workspace_build_regression_count`
- `summary_text`

`has_regressions` preserves the raw compare result: it is true whenever any
scenario crosses the regression threshold. `has_actionable_regressions` is the
operator-facing status bit: it remains false when all threshold hits are covered
by a suspected whole-run environment variance classification. Slack Workflow
Builder templates should use the flat `environment_variance_*` fields above;
when `environment_variance_detected` is true, render
`environment_variance_detail` and
`environment_variance_covered_regression_count` as warning context, not as a
failed benchmark by itself.

When a candidate report declares `selected_repo`, comparison is limited to that
repository. Scenarios from other baseline repositories were intentionally not
run and are not reported as missing-candidate regressions.

Slack-side setup:

- update the Slack Workflow Builder message template to consume the benchmark payload above rather than the older Brokk perf-only fields
- the existing shared fields `ok`, `error_text`, `workflow_run_url`, `head_sha_short`, and `base_sha_short` can be reused directly
- replace old perf-specific fields such as `time_*`, `fps_*`, and `coarse_memory_ok` with benchmark-oriented summary content
- keep the current two-message shape if desired: a top-level run summary plus a threaded follow-up with benchmark-specific operator guidance
- do not assume the old Brokk bisect guidance still applies unless the Slack-side thread text is intentionally updated for this workflow

## Configuration Surface

This directory should be the first place to document any new benchmark-specific workflow variables or secrets.

Current stable configuration comes from `targets.toml`:

- `warmup_iterations`
- `measured_iterations`
- `output_dir`
- `repo_cache_dir`
- `required_languages`
- `required_scenarios`

Future workflow-level settings should stay documented here rather than being introduced only in a GitHub Actions YAML or Slack hook. Expected examples include:

- baseline report path for `compare`
- strict-vs-summary failure mode for scheduled runs
- artifact retention knobs
- Slack channel-routing variables for daily notifications

Slack-facing settings should stay benchmark-scoped and documented here alongside:

- when the notification fires
- what report path or compare summary it links to
- whether a nonzero benchmark exit suppresses or changes the Slack message
- which Slack workflow fields or message templates are expected to consume the payload
