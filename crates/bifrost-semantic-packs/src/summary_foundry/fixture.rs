//! Stage 4: the fixture engine.
//!
//! Every entry the foundry would ship must carry machine-run executable
//! evidence, and that evidence is generated mechanically from the entry, never
//! by the model that proposed it. This module is that generator. It turns one
//! [`FoundryEntry`] into a fixture suite: a minimal workspace that flows
//! attacker-controlled data through the entry's target into a sink, a
//! `require-model` taint policy over that workspace, and the entry compiled
//! into a semantic pack. The suite carries three polarities:
//!
//! - the positive case, which must yield one finding per claimed transfer;
//! - the fail-before control, the same workspace with the entry absent, which
//!   must yield none and report honest incompleteness instead;
//! - the negative case, generated only for an entry that claims `complete`,
//!   which routes taint through an input port the entry does *not* claim and
//!   must yield none. Only a `complete` claim can deny a flow, so only a
//!   `complete` entry gets one.
//!
//! What the fixture proves is executability, not truth. The target's real body
//! is never in the fixture -- it cannot be, because a procedure summary binds
//! only where the workspace has a *declaration without a body* -- so the
//! fixture states: this entry's transfer set, applied to a target of the shape
//! the entry itself declares, survives the production pack compiler, binds
//! through the production binder, and carries taint exactly where it claims and
//! nowhere else. Whether the claim matches the real standard-library body is
//! stage 1's and stage 2's question, not this stage's.
//!
//! The language seam is [`FixtureLanguage`]. Everything above it -- port
//! routing, probe layout, pack assembly, the three polarities, the expected
//! finding counts -- is language independent, so a second language is one
//! implementation of that trait plus one entry in the caller's language table.
