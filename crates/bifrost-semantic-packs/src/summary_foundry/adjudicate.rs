//! Stage 3: the blind-then-graded adjudication harness.
//!
//! Routing follows stage 1's typed incompleteness, exactly as the plan requires:
//!
//! * a fully derivable entry (the derivation met no boundary) ships from the
//!   derived slot and never sees the model;
//! * an underivable entry that CodeQL covers ships the CodeQL translation, and
//!   the model is run over it blind purely to be graded, its proposal discarded;
//! * an underivable entry that no corpus covers enters model proposal, whose
//!   output ships only if it later survives the stage-4 proof gate.
//!
//! The load-bearing property is the calibration discipline. The model proposes
//! BLIND first: [`BlindProposalRequest`] carries the pinned body facts, the
//! partial derivation, and its typed boundaries, but by construction it CANNOT
//! carry the corpus answer, so the blind pass cannot leak it. First-pass
//! agreement against the CodeQL overlap is graded and recorded as the trust
//! metric, stratified by difficulty class (native-boundary versus pure code,
//! arity, receiver-ness). ONLY THEN does the mismatch detail return to the model
//! through [`Adjudicator::reconsider`] as a self-correction signal, after which
//! the model either concedes and repairs or produces a refutation dossier that
//! cross-examines the corpus entry.
//!
//! The model itself is a seam: [`Adjudicator`] is the only interface to it, so a
//! later harness fills it with a real workflow or agent call and the foundry
//! code never names a model API. Tests drive it with a hand-written
//! [`FakeAdjudicator`], so calibration is deterministic and network-free.
