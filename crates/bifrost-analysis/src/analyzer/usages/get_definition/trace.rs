//! The resolution trace: why a reference resolved the way it did (#1474,
//! Milestone 3).
//!
//! The definition resolver decides a reference by walking precedence tiers in
//! statement order and discarding every loser. This module turns that walk into
//! typed rows -- one [`TraceCandidate`] per candidate the resolver considered,
//! carrying the tier it was considered at, whether it was selected or rejected
//! and for which typed reason, how far the lookup could see, and the visibility
//! the declaration states.
//!
//! Three properties are load-bearing.
//!
//! - The trace is an *emission*, never a parallel model. Every row is recorded
//!   at a point where the resolver already computed the fact; nothing here
//!   re-derives a decision, and nothing here can change one. A resolver refactor
//!   therefore cannot silently diverge from the trace: the trace simply reports
//!   less.
//! - Recording is opt-in per batch and off by default. [`recording`] is a
//!   thread-local flag read before any row is built, so an untraced batch pays
//!   one relaxed load per outcome constructor and allocates nothing.
//! - Attribution is never invented. A tier is `None` when the seam that
//!   constructed the outcome cannot name the tier it selected at, rather than
//!   being guessed into a tier a policy would then compare against.
//!
//! Why a thread-local rather than a sink parameter: the three shared outcome
//! constructors this module instruments (`candidates_outcome`,
//! `lexical_definition_outcome` and the boundary gate) are free functions with
//! about three hundred call sites across fourteen per-language resolver modules
//! and the separate `get_type` family. Threading a sink through all of them
//! would put a tracing parameter into every language resolver's signature for a
//! feature none of them reason about. The recorder is installed by
//! [`TraceSession`] for the extent of one batch, drained per request, and
//! removed on drop, so its lifetime is exactly the batch that asked for it.
