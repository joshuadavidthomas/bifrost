//! Kotlin structured reference, usage, and call graphs (issue #1239).
//!
//! Answers "who uses this Kotlin declaration?" from the Kotlin tree-sitter syntax
//! tree and the analyzer's indexed declarations. Nothing here recovers structure
//! by scanning source text, and nothing reports a reference it could not prove:
//! a reference whose identity cannot be established is recorded as *unproven*,
//! which keeps "we don't know" from collapsing into either "yes" or "no".
//!
//! # Where this sits
//!
//! Java, Scala, and Kotlin share one usage *candidate space* — the `Jvm`
//! ecosystem in `crate::analyzer::usages::workspace_graph` — because they compile
//! to one classpath and can name one another's types directly. Kotlin has been a
//! passive member of that space since issue #1237: Java and Scala references can
//! resolve *onto* Kotlin declarations. This module is what makes the realm
//! symmetric by giving Kotlin source references of its own.
//!
//! # Modelled on Java, not Scala
//!
//! Kotlin's identity model is Java's: dotted package-qualified fully-qualified
//! names, arity-distinguished overloads, an ancestor chain for inherited members.
//! Scala's usage graph is several times larger because Scala has `given`/`using`,
//! implicit conversions, `apply`/`unapply` extractors, export clauses, and union
//! types, none of which Kotlin has. So the module structure here mirrors
//! `super::java_graph` — a target model, a forward scan, a hit recorder — while
//! the syntax it reads comes from [`brokk_bifrost_jvm::kotlin::syntax`], shared
//! with the #1238 definition resolver so navigation and usages cannot drift
//! apart.
//!
//! # What this answers
//!
//! Both usage paths. The *query* path ([`shared::KotlinQueryResolver`]) answers
//! "who uses this declaration?" for `scan_usages`, LSP references, and
//! reference-rewriting rename: a reference to a Kotlin type, constructor,
//! function, or property resolves through inheritance, companions, objects,
//! extensions, and receiver chains, with same-owner and unproven references in
//! their own channels. The *edge* path ([`shared::KotlinEdgeResolver`]) builds
//! the whole `caller -> callee` set in one inverted pass, for `usage_graph`,
//! `callers`/`callees`, relevance ranking, and dead-code detection.
//!
//! Both directions share their entire resolution backbone through
//! [`brokk_bifrost_jvm::kotlin::graph::resolver::KotlinResolutionCtx`], so
//! find-references and `usage_graph` cannot disagree about which declaration a
//! call means.
//!
//! Cross-language: a *type* query crosses the realm both ways — a Kotlin class's
//! Java and Scala call sites are reported, and Kotlin files are scanned for Java
//! and Scala class targets. A *member* reference does not cross: which
//! declaration `receiver.member` binds to is decided by the target language's
//! own member-lookup rules, and answering one language's question with another's
//! would be a guess. See `.agents/plans/kotlin-usage-graph-1239.md`.
