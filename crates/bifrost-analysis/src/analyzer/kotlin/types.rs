//! `KotlinAnalyzer`'s two public type-name queries.
//!
//! Kotlin's resolution ladder -- enclosing and inherited scopes, explicit
//! imports, the file's own package, star imports and the platform defaults --
//! moved to [`brokk_bifrost_jvm::kotlin::types`]. What is left is the pair of
//! `pub` methods LSP and the definition route call, plus the reach into
//! [`JvmExternalDeclarationIndex`], which imports `semantic_model` and cannot
//! cross the crate line; the crate asks it two `bool` questions through
//! `KotlinSource` instead of holding a `JvmExternalType`.
