//! The per-file lexical environment derivation layer (#1474, Milestone 2).
//!
//! An identifier resolves against an *environment*: the scopes a file is made
//! of, the bindings each scope introduces, the interval each binding is in
//! effect over, the local names its imports introduce, and the package the
//! file belongs to. Every one of those was previously either absent or private
//! to one language; this module derives all of them from the facts arena plus
//! one per-language hook, and answers the question they exist for — *which
//! binding of this name is in effect at this exact position?*
//!
//! Three properties are load-bearing:
//!
//! - The algorithm is single. Name equality, activation containment, scope
//!   ancestry and nearest-scope-wins are language-neutral; a language
//!   contributes only [`BindingActivation`] per binder token through
//!   [`StructuralSpec::binding_activation`].
//! - Identity is structural, exactly as for occurrence rows: a binding is
//!   addressed by its binder token's `(content_identity, arena node)` pair, so
//!   a capture, an occurrence and a binding over the same token join on one
//!   digest rather than on a range or a spelling.
//! - Nothing is guessed. An adapter that cannot state an interval makes the
//!   file's `BindingIntervals` axis incomplete, and
//!   [`binding_of`] then refuses to answer instead of returning a
//!   plausible winner.
//!
//! Rows are derived per request and never persisted; the facts snapshot
//! underneath them is the cached part.
