//! The bounded rewrite-path derivation layer (issue #1480, milestone 4).
//!
//! One *rewrite path* is one bounded chase through a declared finite rewrite
//! domain: the ordered steps a production analysis took, the bound the domain
//! declared for itself, and how the chase terminated.
//!
//! The first domain is the Rust import-alias chase in
//! `brokk_bifrost_rust::graph_support::resolve_module_package`, whose fix
//! (mined commit `9deded6f5`) is the contract: the semantic state key is the
//! specifier's root, because the rewrite replaces only the root and the
//! specifier grows every hop; the bound is the importing file's binder root
//! count; and the terminal outcome is converged, cycle, or exceeded-budget.
//!
//! The instrumented chase *is* the production chase. This module attaches a
//! [`RewriteTrace`] to
//! [`resolve_module_package_traced`](brokk_bifrost_rust::graph_support::resolve_module_package_traced),
//! which `resolve_module_package` itself calls with no collector; there is no
//! second walk of the binder here, and nothing in this module re-implements a
//! resolution rule.
//!
//! A file the domain does not apply to -- a file that is not Rust, or a Rust
//! file no import of which engages the alias rule -- yields an empty *complete*
//! result. Incompleteness is reserved for what the derivation genuinely could
//! not answer: a cancelled run, a missing Rust analyzer, a file whose source
//! the analyzer no longer holds.
