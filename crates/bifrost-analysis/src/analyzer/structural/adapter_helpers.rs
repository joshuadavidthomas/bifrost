//! Test-only assertions for structural-search language adapters.
//!
//! The production mechanics -- field lookup, role attachment, the argument and
//! callee helpers, and the qualified-chain walks -- are pure node arithmetic
//! and live in [`brokk_bifrost_core::analyzer::structural::adapter_helpers`];
//! they are re-exported below so every adapter still reaches them through
//! `crate::analyzer::structural::adapter_helpers`.
//!
//! These three stay because [`occurrence_roles_of`] extracts facts through
//! [`super::extract`], which is the engine this crate owns; keeping its two
//! companions beside it keeps adapter test support in one place.
