//! The execution adapter between the query engine and Milestone 2's
//! per-file occurrence derivation (#1473).
//!
//! Occurrences are not semantic-artifact backed, so they follow the
//! `ReferenceSite`/`CallSite` pipeline-value pattern: a plain value carried
//! through the pipeline, derived on demand and cached per request.
//!
//! The honesty rule the whole domain exists for lives here: whenever a query
//! names roles the file's adapter cannot classify, this module turns that into
//! an `Incomplete` diagnostic, so an empty answer is never mistaken for "there
//! are none".
