//! The per-file occurrence derivation layer (#1473, Milestone 2).
//!
//! Milestone 1 taught the facts arena what each identifier token *is*; this
//! module turns those classifications into complete rows: range, class,
//! namespace, enclosing declaration, spelling, and — for reference-class rows —
//! the semantic target the definition resolver reports.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing:
//!
//! - Identity is structural. A row is addressed by `(content_identity, node)`,
//!   the same pair a structural capture can carry, so correlation is an
//!   equijoin on a digest rather than range or text coincidence.
//! - Nothing is guessed. Where the adapter cannot assign a namespace, the row
//!   is dropped and the file result records the role as incomplete; a consumer
//!   that asks about that role learns it cannot trust an empty answer.
//!
//! The rows are derived per request and never persisted (see the ExecPlan's
//! decision log); the facts snapshot underneath them is the cached part.
