//! The structural vocabulary a language spec is written against.
//!
//! `kinds` is the normalized kind/role registry; `occurrences`, `resolution`,
//! `edges`, `routes` and `materialization` the identifier-role,
//! lexical-resolution, reference-edge, identity-route and
//! declaration-materialization vocabularies; `spec` the trait each language
//! implements to normalize its grammar; `facts` the two values a spec
//! produces; and `adapter_helpers` the small node-arithmetic mechanics every
//! adapter uses to write one. The extraction engine, matcher, planner and RQL
//! query layer that consume them stay in `brokk-bifrost-analysis`.
