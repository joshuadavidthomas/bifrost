//! The per-language boundary of structural search.
//!
//! A [`StructuralSpec`] is everything a language contributes: a static table

//! optional context-sensitive kind refinement (Python turns a `function`
//! directly inside a `class` into `method`), and role extraction that reads
//! tree-sitter AST *fields* — never source-text splitting — to attach
//! `callee`/`receiver`/`args`/... edges to facts. Everything else (walking,
