//! The declaration-materialization vocabulary: where a declaration comes from,
//! what a generation site produces, and what state a declaration is in
//! (issue #1476).
//!
//! Today the analyzers materialize declarations from macro-like constructs
//! (Ruby `attr_accessor`/`alias_method`, C `#define`), from export forms
//! (JavaScript `export default`/`module.exports`), from declaration-only
//! signatures (Python `@overload`), and from parser recovery over broken
//! source — and record none of it. These enums are the typed values that
//! provenance becomes: a [`DeclarationOrigin`] for how a declaration came to
//! exist, a [`GenerationKind`] and [`GenerationInputClass`] for the construct
//! that produced it and whether its inputs were literal, and an [`ExportForm`]
//! for how an export binds.
//!
//! Support is declared, never assumed: [`DeclarationMaterializationSupport`]
//! is a total table sized by [`MaterializationAxis::COUNT`], so an adapter
//! that says nothing says `Unsupported` for every axis, and a query that
//! depends on an axis the adapter cannot model becomes incomplete rather than
//! silently empty. This mirrors [`super::resolution::LexicalEnvironmentSupport`]
//! exactly. Unlike the occurrence and environment tables, the claimed matrix
//! is deliberately non-uniform across languages: the mined bug shapes are
//! per-language by nature (generation is Ruby and C++, exports are JS/TS,
//! declaration-only linkage is Python), so each language claims exactly the
//! axes its producers compute.
