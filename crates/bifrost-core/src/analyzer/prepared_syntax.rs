//! Live parse state prepared from one exact source snapshot.
//!
//! [`PreparedSyntaxTree`] is what request-time code reads when it needs the
//! actual `tree_sitter::Tree` for a file rather than the persisted declaration
//! facts: usage extraction, resolvers, the per-language semantic lowerers. It
//! holds model-layer data plus a tree, so a language crate below
//! `brokk-bifrost-analysis` can consume one; the preparation pipeline that
//! parses, caches and evicts them stays in the analysis crate.
//!
//! The indexed backing is a [`PreparedSourceIndex`] rather than a concrete
//! type because the analyzer's `FileState` -- the full hydrated per-file record
//! -- is storage machinery. Only the three facts below are part of the
//! contract, so the trait names exactly those and `FileState` implements it.
