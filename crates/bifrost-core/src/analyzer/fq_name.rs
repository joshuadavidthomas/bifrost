//! Interned, kind-tagged qualified names (`FqName`).
//!
//! Bifrost historically identified every declaration by a plain string
//! (`package_name` + `short_name` on [`crate::analyzer::CodeUnit`]). The
//! structure of that string — where one segment ends and the next begins, and
//! what *kind* of segment it is — was not recorded anywhere, so every consumer
//! re-inferred it by splitting on a guessed set of delimiters. That inference
//! is a recurring bug factory (issues 1128/1131/1162/1163).
//!
//! An [`FqName`] records the structure once, at construction, where the
//! language extractor knows exactly what it is emitting. It is an ordered
//! (root-to-leaf) list of [`SegmentId`]s. Each `SegmentId` interns a
//! `(text, kind)` pair, so equality and prefix checks are pure integer
//! comparisons and the segment boundaries are never re-guessed.
//!
//! The interner is process-global and grow-only (see [`segment_interner`]);
//! `SegmentId`s are therefore process-local and must never be persisted (the
//! store persists segment text + kind, never IDs).
