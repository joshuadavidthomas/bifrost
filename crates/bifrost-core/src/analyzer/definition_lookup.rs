//! Bounded lookup of declarations by name.
//!
//! [`CodeUnitIndex`] answers from one analyzer's own declarations.  A resolver
//! or a language scan usually needs a wider view than that -- "does the
//! workspace define this fq name at all" -- and the implementations that can
//! answer it differ in how much they are allowed to touch: a whole-workspace
//! index answers from memory, while a persisted analyzer must route the same
//! question through bounded store queries instead of materializing every
//! declaration.  [`BoundedDefinitionLookup`] is the contract both satisfy, so a
//! caller taking `&dyn BoundedDefinitionLookup` cannot accidentally opt into
//! the unbounded one.
//!
//! The trait lives here, below the usages framework that owns its
//! implementations, so a language crate can ask the question without naming
//! `brokk-bifrost-analysis`'s resolution model.
//!
//! [`CodeUnitIndex`]: crate::analyzer::code_unit_index::CodeUnitIndex
