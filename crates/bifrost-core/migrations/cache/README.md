# Unified cache migrations

`0001-current-baseline.sql` is the schema created by current Bifrost releases.
It is immutable: existing caches with `cache_state` version `1/1/10` are marked
as migration 1 without running it again.

To change the cache schema, append one `M::up(include_str!(...))` entry to
`CACHE_MIGRATIONS` in `src/cache_db.rs` and add its SQL file here. Migration SQL
must contain only schema/data changes, end statements with semicolons, and omit
transaction control and connection PRAGMAs. `rusqlite_migration` runs all pending
entries atomically and stores their count in SQLite's `user_version` header.

Never edit or add a down migration for a released file. This cache is derived
data: an older binary rejects a newer `user_version` without modifying it, while
an unrecognized pre-migration cache is rebuilt from migration 1.

Migration `0013-semantic-model-active-set.sql` adds only workspace-local
semantic-pack activation identity and source references. Immutable pack bytes
and global lifecycle roots belong to the independent semantic-pack catalog.

Migration `0014-semantic-file-documents.sql` replaces the summary/component
semantic schema with path-aware file materializations and direct document
vectors. It discards only rebuildable semantic-index rows; analyzer and
semantic-pack state remain intact.

Migration `0022-drop-bm25-lexical-columns.sql` removes the two columns that
only served the deleted lexical (BM25) retrieval arm:
`semantic_file_chunks.fts_tokens` and `cache_state.bm25_tokenizer_version`.
Retrieval is dense only, so nothing reads them. Chunk and vector rows keep
their identities, so no cache is invalidated by this migration.
