//! The analyzer-resident products C++'s language logic resolves through.
//!
//! `CppAnalyzer` owns five moka caches, three `Arc<OnceLock<..>>` cells and one
//! `PoolSafeMemo`; every one of them stays in `brokk-bifrost-analysis` because
//! `IAnalyzer::update`/`update_all` rebuild the analyzer wholesale through
//! `Self::from_inner`. What crosses the crate line is the *decision* that fills
//! each cell -- the builders in [`crate::hierarchy`], [`crate::identity`] and
//! [`crate::imports`] -- plus this trait, which is how a free function reaches
//! back for a memoized product without naming the analyzer type.
//!
//! The census found no re-entrancy among these accessors, so this is a single
//! tier rather than the two-tier split some fleet languages needed: the #1134
//! reconciliation reads `visible_type_units`, which reads `include_target_index`
//! and the supertrait's `import_statements`, and none of those reads back into
//! reconciliation.
//!
//! Three members are load-bearing beyond their signature:
//!
//! * [`CppSource::visible_type_units`] is the moka-cached include-closure
//!   class table. Its *builder* is [`crate::hierarchy::build_cpp_visible_type_units`];
//!   the cell and its `test-support` build counter stay analyzer-side, so this
//!   accessor is the only way the reconciler reaches a warm table.
//! * [`CppSource::raw_supertypes_of`] is
//!   `TreeSitterAnalyzer::raw_supertypes_of`, whose rows are crate-private to
//!   analysis; the analyzer hands the decoded base-specifier strings across.
