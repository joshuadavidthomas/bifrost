//! The C++ usage graph's language knowledge.
//!
//! The forward scan ([`extractor`] plus [`hits`]), the visibility/macro/include
//! resolver ([`resolver`]) and the whole-workspace inverted per-file walk
//! ([`inverted`]) are one body of code and crossed together: `extractor` glob
//! imports `resolver`, `hits` reads `extractor`'s scan context, and `inverted`
//! names forty items from the other two.
//!
//! No analyzer handle appears here. `brokk-bifrost-analysis` downcasts once and
//! hands over a [`CppGraphSource`] -- the *dispatching* analyzer's side of a
//! scan -- which carries the [`CppSource`] the memoized C++ products
//! come from.
