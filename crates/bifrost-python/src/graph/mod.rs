/// The *dispatching* analyzer's side of a Python usage-graph scan.
///
/// Deliberately not the Python analyzer: in a mixed workspace the query is
/// issued against a `MultiAnalyzer`, whose `definitions` merges every language's
/// shards and whose `get_ancestors` crosses language boundaries. The walks
/// depend on that reach, so this stays separate from the
/// [`PythonUsageSource`](crate::graph_support::PythonUsageSource) that answers
/// the Python-only questions.
///
/// `definitions` is a callback rather than a handle because the analyzer's
/// global definition index is built lazily on first access and only
/// [`resolver::resolve_receiver_type`]'s last fallback reaches it; returning a
/// handle would force the build at every scan.
