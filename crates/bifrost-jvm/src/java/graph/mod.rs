/// The *dispatching* analyzer's side of a Java usage-graph scan.

/// Deliberately not the Java analyzer, for the reason recorded on
/// `PythonGraphSource`: in a mixed workspace the query is issued against a
/// `MultiAnalyzer`, whose `definitions` merges every language's shards and whose
/// `get_ancestors` crosses language boundaries. Java depends on that reach
/// twice over -- the JVM realm is one candidate space (#1237), so a Java file
/// naming a Kotlin or Scala class next door resolves only through the merged
/// index -- so this stays separate from the
/// [`JavaSource`](crate::java::graph_support::JavaSource) that answers the
/// Java-only questions.
