//! Kotlin type-name resolution (#1237).
//!
//! Turns a name as *spelled* in Kotlin source (`Base`, `Outer.Inner`,
//! `lib.Base`, an aliased `Parent`) into the fully-qualified name it denotes,
//! then into a workspace declaration or an entry in the shared JVM dependency
//! index.
//!
//! # How Kotlin resolves a name
//!
//! For a dotted name, Kotlin resolves the *first* segment as a name in scope
//! and descends from there; only if that fails is the whole name treated as
//! absolute. This is the one place Kotlin differs sharply from Scala, which
//! also searches enclosing packages — `lib.Base` written inside package `app`
//! never means `app.lib.Base` in Kotlin.
//!
//! A single segment is looked for, in order:
//!
//! 1. the enclosing declarations of the reference site (a class can name its
//!    own nested types without qualification), and the nested types those
//!    declarations inherit;
//! 2. an explicit import, under its alias when it has one;
//! 3. the file's own package;
//! 4. star imports — and if two star imports bind the same simple name to
//!    different owners the reference is *ambiguous*, which Kotlin rejects, so
//!    resolution reports the ambiguity instead of picking a winner;
//! 5. Kotlin's default imports (`kotlin.*`, `java.lang.*`, …).
//!
//! Every tier is a lookup against a caller-supplied "does this fully-qualified
//! name exist" predicate, so the same ladder serves workspace-source
//! resolution, hierarchy resolution, and jar-backed dependency resolution
//! without three copies of the precedence rules.
