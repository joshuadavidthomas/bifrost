//! Recording a Kotlin reference as a usage hit, and attributing it to a caller.
//!
//! Every hit carries the declaration that encloses it, because "who uses this?"
//! is only useful if the answer says *from where*. Attribution goes through
//! `IAnalyzer::enclosing_code_unit`, cached per byte range because a single
//! reference is asked about several times while it is being classified.
//!
//! There are three channels, and keeping them apart is most of what "explicit"
//! means in this issue's acceptance criteria. [`push_hit`] records a *proven*
//! reference, one whose identity the scan established. [`push_unproven_hit`]
//! records a reference that might name the target but could not be proven.
//! [`push_self_receiver_hit`] records a proven reference whose receiver is the
//! current instance or the own type, which the cross-language contract of #1014
//! facet B excludes from the external usage surface.
//!
//! A *type* reference only ever lands in the first of the three: a written type
//! either resolves to the target or does not, with no receiver to be unsure
//! about. The other two exist for the callable and property arms.
