//! The analyzer-resident products Kotlin's language logic resolves through.
//!
//! `KotlinAnalyzer` owns four moka caches (two of them realm-scoped), three
//! `Arc<OnceLock<..>>` cells and two `PoolSafeMemo`s; every one of them stays
//! in `brokk-bifrost-analysis` because `IAnalyzer::update`/`update_all` rebuild
//! the analyzer wholesale through `Self::from_inner`, and the realm-keyed pairs
//! answer a strictly wider question than their Kotlin-only siblings. What
//! crosses the crate line is [`KotlinSource`], the same idiom `JavaSource`,
//! `ScalaSource` and `RubySource` landed.
//!
//! Two members carry more than their signature.
//! [`KotlinSource::external_index_is_empty`] and
//! [`KotlinSource::external_qualified_name_exists`] are the only two questions
//! Kotlin's resolution ladder asks `JvmExternalDeclarationIndex` -- the
//! classpath-artifact index built out of `analyzer/jvm/`, which is parked in
//! `brokk-bifrost-analysis` with the rest of the `semantic_model` band. The
//! answers are a `bool` each, so they cross where `JvmExternalType` cannot:
//! nothing in this crate ever holds an external type, and
//! [`crate::kotlin::types::KotlinTypeResolution::External`] therefore carries
//! no payload. This is `ScalaSource::simple_type_knownness`'s shape, narrowed
//! -- Kotlin's ladder needs only "does the classpath know this name", never
//! what the classpath knows about it.
//!
//! `KotlinAnalyzer` lives in `brokk-bifrost-analysis`; this crate never names
//! it.
