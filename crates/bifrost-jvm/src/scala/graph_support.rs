//! The analyzer-resident products Scala's language logic resolves through.
//!
//! `ScalaAnalyzer` owns four moka caches, six `Arc<OnceLock<..>>` cells and two
//! `PoolSafeMemo`s; every one of them stays in `brokk-bifrost-analysis` because
//! `IAnalyzer::update`/`update_all` rebuild the analyzer wholesale through
//! `Self::from_inner`. What crosses the crate line is [`ScalaSource`], which is
//! how a free function reaches back for a memoized product without naming the
//! analyzer type -- the same idiom `RubySource` and `CppSource` landed.
//!
//! [`ScalaSource::simple_type_proof`] and [`ScalaSource::simple_term_proof`]
//! are load-bearing beyond their signature. Both answer "what does every
//! retained surface prove about this bare Scala name", and both consult
//! `JvmExternalDeclarationIndex` -- the
//! classpath-artifact index built out of `analyzer/jvm/`, which is parked in
//! `brokk-bifrost-analysis` with the rest of the `semantic_model` band. That
//! index is why they are trait members rather than moved bodies: the decision
//! they make is Scala's, but one of the facts it reads is not reachable from
//! this crate.
//!
//! The three types beneath the trait are the same story told about indexes
//! rather than about the analyzer. [`ScalaDefinitionIndex`] and
//! [`ScalaCallableFactsIndex`] are the exact slices of the analysis-side
//! `GlobalUsageDefinitionIndex` and `UsageFactsIndex` that the graph reads;
//! lowering either whole would move a genuinely analysis-side product for a
//! handful of questions, so the crate line is drawn at the answers -- the
//! `PhpCallableFacts` precedent. [`ScalaFileFacts`] is the same cut through the
//! analyzer's per-file `FileState`: thirteen fields of the twenty-five it
//! carries, decoded shim-side and handed across, the way Ruby's owner-relation
//! facts cross.
