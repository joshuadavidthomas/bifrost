//! The JVM realm's bundled tree-sitter query assets.
//!
//! The `.scm` files ship inside this crate rather than
//! `brokk-bifrost-analysis/resources/` and are embedded at compile time, so a
//! consumer never resolves them from a runtime path. `brokk-bifrost-analysis`
//! folds [`JVM_QUERY_ASSETS`] into the per-language store epoch exactly as it
//! folds its own `resources/treesitter/<lang>/` files: the entry paths keep the
//! historical `treesitter/java/` and `treesitter/scala/` prefixes so the
//! epoch's per-language filter is one rule rather than two.
//!
//! Kotlin contributes no entry. Its `highlights.scm` is read by
//! `KotlinSupport::highlight_query` and its `tags.scm` is excluded from the
//! published archive; neither has ever been part of the salted content, so
//! `treesitter/kotlin/` selects nothing here and Kotlin's epoch is grammar
//! fingerprint plus salt only.
