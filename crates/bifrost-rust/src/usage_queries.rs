//! Query-time composition over the persisted per-file Rust usage facts.
//!
//! This is the read side of the tables Milestone 1 of
//! `.agents/plans/rust-usage-index-v2.md` added. Where Rust usage analysis
//! used to answer a question from seventeen workspace-wide maps built
//! wholesale into heap, `RustUsageQueries` answers it from rows: the file's own
//! facts for a per-file question, and one indexed lookup plus per-candidate
//! verification for a name question.
//!
//! Two contracts govern everything here, both taken from IntelliJ (see
//! `.agents/docs/intellij-indexing-research-2026-08.md`):
//!
//! An inverted lookup returns CANDIDATES, never answers. "This file mentions
//! the name `foo`" is all `rust_identifier_occurrences` claims; deciding
//! whether that mention is a usage of a particular declaration is the caller's
//! verification step. IntelliJ states the same contract on `IdIndex`, where it
//! is forced by hash collisions; here it is forced by the fact that a name is
//! not an identity.
//!
//! Nothing persisted is path-derived, because blob rows are content-keyed and
//! two byte-identical files share one row set. The stored module names are
//! relative to each file's own root, and this module composes them with the
//! live file's package name on the way out. That composition is the only place
//! a path enters, and it is why `facts_of` takes a `ProjectFile` rather than an
//! `Oid`.
