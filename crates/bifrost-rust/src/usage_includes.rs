//! Include-expansion routes, composed backwards from per-blob rows.
//!
//! Rust's `include!("path")` splices another file's tokens into a host. The
//! included file keeps its own physical identity in the declaration index, but
//! its imports resolve at the host, so a usage found in an included file has to
//! be attributed through the host's crate, module and import bindings. That
//! attribution is a [`RustIncludeRoute`].
//!
//! The v1 index built every route in the workspace eagerly, forwards: seed one
//! route per (file, owning root), then breadth-first along include edges,
//! threading the module package and the accumulated host bindings, and key the
//! resulting map by the INCLUDED file. That is a whole-workspace materialization
//! and it is exactly what usage v2 removes.
//!
//! Here the same relation is read backwards, one question at a time. For the
//! forward build,
//!
//! ```text
//! routes(T) = { compose(R, E) : H --E--> T, R in seeds(H) + routes(H) }
//! ```
//!
//! which is a recursion on `T` that needs only T's includers -- so the question
//! "what are this file's include routes" costs the includers it actually has,
//! not the workspace.
//!
//! Finding those includers is the same candidate-then-verify contract
//! `usage_queries.rs` documents for `rust_identifier_occurrences`.
//! `rust_include_edges` is indexed by `file_name`, the literal's last path
//! component, which answers "which blobs include something called this" --
//! CANDIDATES. Each candidate is confirmed by resolving that candidate's own
//! stored `relative_path` against that candidate's own directory and comparing
//! to the file being asked about, so verification touches one row per candidate
//! and the cost is the number of files that include a file of that name.
//!
//! The upward walk is iterative with an explicit queue and bounded by the same
//! `(host_file, route)` visited set the forward build relies on for the same
//! cycle. Its result is memoized per included file in `RustWalkCaches`, which
//! retires with the analyzer generation like every other cross-file walk cache.
