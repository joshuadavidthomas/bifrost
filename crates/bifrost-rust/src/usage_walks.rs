//! Bounded, memoized cross-file walks over the per-file Rust usage facts.
//!
//! This is the third layer of `.agents/plans/rust-usage-index-v2.md`. Milestone
//! 2a made the per-file questions store-backed and 2b did the same for the
//! inverted-derivable ones; what this file carries is the group that is
//! genuinely cross-file -- module-file resolution, physical ownership, alias
//! routes, effective module domains, forward import edges, export chains, and
//! macro scope visibility.
//!
//! Each of those was a workspace-wide map built wholesale at index-build time.
//! Here each is a walk from a seed, memoized in a bounded cache on the analyzer.
//! The analyzer instance IS the generation: `RustAnalyzer::update` and
//! `update_all` construct a fresh analyzer with fresh caches, so a cache living
//! here needs only the query key. That is the same argument the Milestone 2b
//! Decision Log records for `declaration_facts`, and it applies for the same
//! reason: every derivation below consults analyzer state (structural parents,
//! visibility, Cargo routes, the analyzed-file set), not only file bytes, so a
//! content-hash key would claim an invariance these values do not have.
