//! The analyzer-resident products Ruby's language logic resolves through.
//!
//! `RubyAnalyzer` owns three moka caches, nine `Arc<OnceLock<..>>` cells and one
//! `PoolSafeMemo`; every one of them stays in `brokk-bifrost-analysis` because
//! `IAnalyzer::update`/`update_all` rebuild the analyzer wholesale through
//! `Self::from_inner`. What crosses the crate line is the *decision* that fills
//! each cell -- the builders in [`crate::imports`], [`crate::mixins`] and
//! [`crate::hierarchy`] -- plus this trait, which is how a free function reaches
//! back for a memoized product without naming the analyzer type.
//!
//! Two members are load-bearing beyond their signature:
//!
//! * [`RubySource::forward_owner_relation_facts`] is the one accessor with no
//!   landed precedent. Its body reads `TreeSitterAnalyzer::fetch_file_state`,
//!   whose `Arc<FileState>` is crate-private to analysis, so it stays there and
//!   hands the decoded facts across (the Py-2 `collect_bounded` precedent).
//! * [`RubySource::all_files`] is `TreeSitterAnalyzer::all_files`, i.e. the
//!   analyzed *live* file set. `CodeUnitIndex::analyzed_files` is a different
//!   query, so this is spelled out rather than inferred from the supertrait.
