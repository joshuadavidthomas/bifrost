/// The *dispatching* analyzer's side of a Ruby usage-graph scan.
///
/// Deliberately not the Ruby analyzer, for the reason recorded on
/// `PythonGraphSource`: in a mixed workspace the query is issued against a
/// `MultiAnalyzer`, whose `definitions` merges every language's shards and whose
/// enclosing-unit lookup crosses language boundaries. The walks depend on that
/// reach, so this stays separate from the
/// [`RubySource`](crate::graph_support::RubySource) that answers the Ruby-only
/// questions.
///
/// `definitions` is a callback rather than a handle because the analyzer's
/// global definition index is built lazily on first access and only the
/// factory-return inference in [`extractor`] reaches it; the diagnostics pass
/// builds a [`resolver::RubySemanticIndex`] and never touches it at all, so
/// returning a handle would force the build there too.
