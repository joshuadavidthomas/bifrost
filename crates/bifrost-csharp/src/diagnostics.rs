//! C#'s semantic diagnostics: every name this pass checks, classified as
//! resolved, absent with a complete proof, or suppressed with a typed reason.
//!
//! The analyzer facts this needs are a [`CSharpSource`] for the workspace half
//! and a [`CSharpExternalEvidence`] view of the retained assembly index for the
//! other half. `analyzer/csharp/diagnostics.rs` in `brokk-bifrost-analysis`
//! keeps the downcast that produces them, because this crate cannot name
//! `CSharpExternalDeclarationIndex`.
//!
//! No path here may read an assembly, `project.assets.json`, or a NuGet cache,
//! and none may build an index. State a request cannot read is a typed
//! [`SemanticDiagnosticIncompleteReason`], never a guess and never an error.
//! That makes this pass's evidence a strict subset of the resolver's, so a
//! diagnostic can only ever fall further toward incompleteness than a
//! `get_definition` for the same reference, never past it into a false error.
//!
//! # What this pass checks
//!
//! `using` directives (namespace, alias and static forms), type references in
//! the positions the grammar reserves for one, and member accesses whose owner
//! this pass can prove. Everything else -- a bare identifier, a receiver whose
//! type is not proven, a `dynamic` value -- is left unchecked rather than
//! guessed at, because an outcome is a claim about a lookup that happened.
