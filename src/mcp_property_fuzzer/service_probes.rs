//! Service-layer probes and the I1(c)/I2–I5 checkers.
//!
//! Probe inputs derive from the same deterministic symbol sample I1 uses;
//! symbols with I1 range violations are excluded so truncated ranges cannot
//! poison derived contexts (the plan's "I1 is a prerequisite" rule). Probes
//! execute through `SearchToolsService::call_tool_output` exactly as the MCP
//! handler would — workspace-relative paths, JSON argument values — and every
//! probe except the expensive scans runs in both `render_line_numbers`
//! modes; checkers consume the structured payload and compare the mode-B
//! structured payload for drift.
//!
//! Invariants checked here (see `.agents/plans/mcp_property_fuzzer.md`):
//! - I1(c): every `SourceBlock` returned by `get_symbol_sources` must carry
//!   text identical to the file content at its reported range.
//! - I2: for each sampled symbol the selector spellings an agent plausibly
//!   writes — terminal name, fully qualified name, `path#terminal`,
//!   `path#qualified` — must resolve consistently: a strictly more specific
//!   spelling must never fail where a less specific one succeeds, and two
//!   resolved spellings must name the same declaration. Single-entry and
//!   multi-entry `get_definitions_by_reference` batches must agree.
//! - I3: (a) a symbol `get_summaries` lists under file F must resolve via
//!   `get_symbol_sources` with path F; (b) a symbol `scan_usages_by_reference`
//!   resolves must appear in `search_symbols` results for its terminal name;
//!   (c) no response may both render content for a target and report that
//!   same target in its `not_found` list. Also cross-cutting: the structured
//!   payload must not drift between render modes.
//! - I4: a failure message must not claim non-indexing ("not indexed",
//!   "outside the indexed workspace", "external crate/module") when
//!   `search_symbols` finds an in-workspace declaration with that name.
//! - I5: every failure-status response must carry actionable next-step
//!   content — a note, a candidate list, or diagnostics; an empty refusal is
//!   a violation. Probed both organically and through a small fixed set of
//!   negative shapes real agents produced in traces.
