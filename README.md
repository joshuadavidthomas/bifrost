# Why bifrost

`bifrost` is Brokk's Rust-based static analysis toolbox for AI coding harnesses,
editors, and large repositories.

In a nutshell:

1. Bifrost parses unbuilt or partially broken repositories, including mixed-language workspaces.
1. Bifrost is designed for concurrency, with snapshot isolation and fast incremental updates when code changes underneath.
1. Bifrost is fast and lazy; it avoids optional work such as import analysis unless a request needs it.
1. Bifrost is built to be git- and worktree- aware; its index is content-based and won't need to reindex code it's seen before on any branch.
1. Bifrost can be used through MCP, LSP, the command line, Python, or Rust.

## Language Coverage

Bifrost includes analyzers for C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Scala, and TypeScript.

GitHub Pages publication is handled by `.github/workflows/docs.yml`. Release tag
builds publish both the latest docs site and a versioned snapshot under
`versions/<tag>/`.
