# Establish measured artifact lifecycles for issue #817

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.

This document follows `.agents/PLANS.md`. It implements GitHub issue #817, “Engineer compact semantic graph snapshots and lifecycle-aware persistence.” Reusable procedure, taint, and protocol summaries do not yet exist, so their storage shape and persistence decision remain downstream work with #820 and #823 rather than unfinished #817 scope.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Bifrost already has several different analysis artifacts with deliberately different lifetimes. Per-file structural facts are packed in SQLite because cross-process hydration proved worthwhile. Complete semantic artifacts and callable control-flow graphs are retained in a bounded memory cache because an equivalent persistence experiment failed its cold-write gate. ICFG slices, oracle projections, and data-flow work are request- or generation-local. Those decisions are currently spread across plans, benchmark tests, and implementation comments.

After this checkpoint, a contributor can inspect one artifact matrix to learn who owns each artifact, how it is identified and invalidated, what representation it uses, what evidence supports its current lifetime, and which measurements are required before changing that decision. Benchmark authors can evaluate persistence candidates with one typed promotion-gate API rather than copying thresholds. A fresh-process data-flow lifecycle benchmark will demonstrate the cost and retained size of the current bounded exploded state while recording that it is intentionally ephemeral, not a persistence candidate.

The observable outcome is a retained benchmark report over generated projects, inline TypeScript and Java, and exact pinned VS Code and Spring PetClinic revisions. It reports semantic/ICFG construction, first and repeated solver execution, counts, work, memory, completeness, and checksums. It does not create a database table or pretend that repeated rebuilding of query-owned work is a cache miss.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-07-24 07:41Z) Verified the clean existing #817 branch, fetched `origin`, and fast-forwarded it from `7748331e` to current `origin/master` at `71b3d3f8`.
- [x] (2026-07-24 07:41Z) Re-read `.agents/PLANS.md`, the live issue, the semantic roadmap, the completed CFG/ICFG and oracle lifecycle evidence, the structural snapshot implementation, and the first bounded #820 solver child.
- [x] (2026-07-24 07:44Z) Published the artifact lifecycle matrix and checkpointed the plan in `b1aeef86`.
- [x] (2026-07-24 07:49Z) Added the reusable artifact-promotion benchmark API, migrated the semantic CFG persistence gate without changing its report shape, and passed focused unit and integration tests.
- [x] (2026-07-24 08:08Z) Added the fresh-process data-flow lifecycle benchmark and runner; seven non-ignored schema/behavior tests pass, and release smokes select and solve the exact pinned VS Code and Spring PetClinic procedures.
- [x] (2026-07-24 08:27Z) Ran 72 fresh release processes, retained and invariant-checked 56 samples across all eight required datasets, and recorded the medians, raw timing/RSS rows, provenance, and `ephemeral_not_eligible` decision.
- [x] (2026-07-24 10:16Z) Completed the feature-enabled repository test matrix on the host: all library, binary, integration, and doc-test targets passed; the library target reported 1,870 passed, zero failed, and five ignored.
- [x] (2026-07-24 10:50Z) Completed security, duplication, intent, DevOps, and architecture reviews; hardened provenance, promotion-state consistency, signal cleanup, locked execution, and topology validation in response.
- [x] (2026-07-24 11:05Z) Re-ran the complete 72-process v2 matrix after review. All 56 retained samples reproduced canonical typed ICFG topology and result identity, and the report now contains the reviewed provenance, medians, and raw rows.
- [x] (2026-07-24 11:12Z) Passed the final focused unit and integration tests, formatting, shell syntax, diff hygiene, and strict locked all-target/all-feature Clippy in a cleaned isolated target.
- [x] (2026-07-24 11:21Z) Re-verified the live issue and current `origin/master`; #817 acceptance is complete, future summary work remains owned by dependent #823, and a read-only merge simulation found no conflict with the 12 newer upstream commits.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: issue #820 is still open, but its first bounded context-respecting data-flow child is already on `master`.
  Evidence: commit `201770cd` added `src/analyzer/dataflow/`; its checked-in ExecPlan explicitly defers reusable summaries, recursive summary convergence, witnesses, and persistence.

- Observation: the current persistence gate is decision-grade but local to one ignored integration benchmark.
  Evidence: `tests/measure_semantic_cfg_persistence.rs::gate_for_dataset` owns the six threshold checks and aggregate conjunction that later candidates need to reuse.

- Observation: the existing semantic/CFG and oracle measurements answer different lifecycle questions.
  Evidence: `.agents/docs/semantic-cfg-lifecycle-benchmark-2026-07-20.md` tested an optimistic equivalent packed projection and rejected production SQLite on cold-write overhead; `.agents/docs/semantic-oracle-lifecycle-benchmark-2026-07-21.md` measured memory-cache and query-arena behavior but did not build a persistence candidate.

- Observation: the issue branch was one commit behind `origin/master`, and the delta changed release metadata only.
  Evidence: fast-forward `7748331e..71b3d3f8` changed the VS Code and plugin release metadata files without touching analysis code.

- Observation: peak RSS is process-cumulative, so measuring every dataset sequentially in one process would attach allocator history from earlier datasets to later rows.
  Evidence: the initial benchmark draft used one process for all datasets. The corrected runner launches nine fresh processes per dataset and records one process peak on that dataset, not separate client peaks.

- Observation: both pinned external roots resolve uniquely through structured declaration suffixes, and both bounded ICFGs remain traversable while visibly incomplete.
  Evidence: the VS Code `Function(quickSelect)` release smoke produced 31 reachable nodes with an `unknown` outcome and two boundaries; Spring PetClinic `Type(OwnerController)::Method(processFindForm)` produced 41 reachable nodes with an `unsupported` outcome and two boundaries. Both clients reached fixed points without claiming complete coverage.

- Observation: workspace RSS and exploded-result size are different lifecycle signals.
  Evidence: the reviewed VS Code median process peak was 657.3 MiB while its finite result's public shallow slices were 5,136 bytes. The largest result was instead the complete 512-branch finite workload at 98,313 reached states and 1,179,940 shallow bytes, with an 87.5 MiB process peak.

- Observation: immediate repeated execution is not reliably faster and is not cache reuse.
  Evidence: the reviewed complete 512-branch finite workload had 31.526 ms first-solve and 28.001 ms repeat-solve medians while preserving exact work and checksums. The benchmark reports both timings without treating their difference as a hydration speedup.

- Observation: integer ratio comparisons need exact overflow-safe arithmetic at their equality boundaries.
  Evidence: the complete test matrix exposed a large-value serialized-size boundary that the initial saturating multiplication implementation rejected. The evaluator now cross-multiplies in `u128`, and the exact-boundary regression passes.

- Observation: snapshot-local graph identity is not decision-grade topology identity.
  Evidence: the first review hardening pass hashed pointer-backed and mount-specific node identities, which made equivalent Spring PetClinic graphs differ across fresh temporary roots. The v2 checksum instead sorts stable procedure-local node labels, typed edges, and typed boundaries while excluding pointers, dense numbering, and temporary workspace mounts.

- Observation: collecting source provenance can accidentally invalidate Cargo's build-script inputs.
  Evidence: each benchmark process originally ran ordinary `git status`, refreshing the worktree index that `build.rs` watches and causing repeated release rebuilds. The runner now sets `GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS=0`; later rounds reuse the existing release build while still recording dirty state and the streamed tree fingerprint.

- Observation: toolchain provenance and host test permissions both mattered during full validation.
  Evidence: Homebrew `cargo-clippy` initially paired with the wrong LLVM/rustc driver until the Rustup 1.96.0 proxy paths were supplied explicitly. The managed sandbox also denied three MCP helper-subprocess tests; the identical host-side `nlp,python` command passed every enabled target.

- Observation: the pinned Spring checkout acquired two Finder metadata files during local inspection.
  Evidence: the untracked `.DS_Store` files were moved recoverably to `/private/tmp/spring-petclinic-ds-store-019f92ff/`; both external repositories were clean before the reviewed matrix ran.

## Decision Log

- Decision: make this checkpoint a lifecycle foundation, not a summary-storage implementation.
  Rationale: raw semantic/CFG persistence already has a measured no-go, oracle arenas are query-owned, and reusable summary types do not yet exist. Defining a packed summary DTO now would freeze an implementation-shaped format without a concrete consumer.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-24 / Codex

- Decision: standardize promotion gates in the existing public `benchmark` module rather than adding a runtime artifact registry.
  Rationale: persistence promotion is an experimental decision made from fresh-process samples. Runtime caches still need domain-specific keys and completeness rules; a central runtime registry would obscure rather than enforce those semantics.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-24 / Codex

- Decision: missing or invalid measurements make a candidate ineligible.
  Rationale: unavailable RSS, a zero rebuild duration, non-finite or negative timings, or impossible byte measurements cannot safely support promotion. The evaluator must report the missing/invalid observation rather than treating it as a pass.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-24 / Codex

- Decision: preserve the six predeclared CFG persistence thresholds as the issue-wide default gate.
  Rationale: changing thresholds after observing a result would invalidate the prior decision process. Candidates may declare stricter thresholds, but a looser exception requires a new recorded decision before samples are collected.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-24 / Codex

- Decision: classify bounded data-flow results and worklists as `ephemeral_not_eligible`.
  Rationale: they contain concrete seeds, run-local dense fact IDs, budgets, truncations, and path-quality frontiers. Repeating the same solve measures their cost but does not create semantic reuse identity. #823 summaries are the separate reusable projection.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-24 / Codex

- Decision: use nine fresh processes per dataset with two discarded warmups and seven retained samples.
  Rationale: this matches the completed semantic CFG persistence protocol, keeps process startup, allocator state, and page-cache effects visible in the raw evidence, and makes process-peak RSS attributable to one dataset.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-24 / Codex

- Decision: bind retained solver evidence to a canonical typed-topology checksum rather than graph counts or snapshot-local IDs.
  Rationale: equal node/edge/boundary counts cannot prove equal topology, while raw node identities include pointers, dense numbering, and workspace mounts that legitimately vary between processes. Stable procedure-local labels plus every typed edge and typed boundary capture the semantic input the clients actually consumed.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-24 / Codex

## Outcomes & Retrospective

The reusable promotion evaluator, corrected lifecycle matrix, and reproducible data-flow lifecycle report are implemented. The reviewed v2 run used Bifrost `a9daea53` plus the fingerprinted review changes, rustc 1.96.0, macOS arm64, exact clean VS Code and Spring PetClinic revisions, nine fresh processes per dataset, and seven retained samples per group. All 56 retained samples had stable canonical typed topology, work, results, and checksums; all clients reached fixed points; incomplete ICFG inputs remained incomplete.

The measurements support a narrow conclusion: bounded exploded data-flow states are request-local and not eligible for persistence. They do not measure an equivalent reusable serialized candidate, so they are not a persistence no-go for the procedure summaries deferred to #823. No production persistence, cache, packed data-flow DTO, or durable `FactId` was introduced.

Review materially improved the evidence boundary. The promotion result can no longer carry a contradictory aggregate boolean; untracked symlinks are fingerprinted without following them; large files are streamed; host provenance omits the hostname; runner builds are locked and interruption-safe; and retained samples prove the exact canonical typed ICFG topology rather than only its counts. The complete feature-enabled suite passed on the host, and the reviewed result passed the final focused tests, formatting, shell syntax, diff hygiene, and strict all-target/all-feature Clippy.

The live #817 acceptance criteria are satisfied. Every currently promoted or measured artifact has a documented lifecycle and identity boundary; existing structural and semantic/CFG evidence covers parity, compact traversal, warm reuse, safe invalidation, corruption, and promotion failure; the new solver measurement carries the required provenance, size, work, cache-status, and completeness fields; and no query-local state is persisted or eagerly hydrated. #823 explicitly depends on #817 and owns the future summary algebra, in-memory reuse, and any separately measured summary-persistence promotion.

## Context and Orientation

`src/compact_graph.rs` contains `CompactRows<T>` and `CompactDirectedGraph<K>`, the shared immutable dense-row primitives. `CompactRows` stores a boxed `u32` row-boundary array and a boxed value array. `CompactDirectedGraph` owns snapshot-local node identities plus outgoing CSR and incoming CSC rows. CSR means a compact row representation optimized for outgoing traversal; CSC is the corresponding incoming representation.

`src/analyzer/structural/facts.rs` defines per-file syntax facts and their packed snapshot DTO. `migrations/cache/0007-structural-facts-snapshots.sql` keys persisted rows by content blob OID, language, and snapshot format version. `src/analyzer/structural/provider.rs` hydrates that representation only for generation-live disk content and treats missing, corrupt, or incompatible rows as misses.

`src/analyzer/semantic/ids.rs::SemanticArtifactKey` identifies one mounted immutable source artifact by workspace mount, workspace-relative path, language, disk or overlay source revision, adapter version, semantic IR version, configuration, and dependency fingerprint. `src/analyzer/semantic/service.rs::CompleteSemanticArtifactCache` caches only complete validated artifacts, uses strict same-key single flight, and bounds retained weight. `src/analyzer/semantic/icfg.rs::IcfgSnapshot` stitches context-bearing nodes and matched call/return edges on demand for one workspace generation and explicit limits.

`src/analyzer/semantic/oracle/` defines request-bounded value-flow, dispatch, heap, alias, and access-path results. They retain explicit completeness and uncertainty. They are not complete whole-workspace indexes.

`src/analyzer/dataflow/` contains the first #820 solver child. `solve` consumes an outcome-derived `IcfgSolveInput`, a finite distributive problem, a five-dimensional `SolverBudget`, and cancellation. It creates run-local `FactId`s, reached states, path-quality frontiers, worklists, coverage, and a deterministic `DataflowResult`. No data-flow cache or summary store currently exists.

`tests/measure_semantic_cfg_persistence.rs` is the existing persistence experiment. Its local gate requires at least 30 percent and 50 milliseconds of hydration improvement, at most 10 percent hydration RSS growth, serialized bytes no more than twice estimated hydrated bytes, and build-plus-write overhead no more than 25 percent or 250 milliseconds. Every required external corpus must pass every gate.

The two pinned external repositories are:

- VS Code at `19e0f9e681ecb8e5c09d8784acaa601316ca4571`, supplied through `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_TS_REPO`.
- Spring PetClinic at `f182358d02e4a68e52bdbabf55ca7800288511e7`, supplied through `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_JAVA_REPO`.

The local validated checkouts are `/Users/dave/Workspace/test-repos/vscode-semantic-cfg` and `/Users/dave/Workspace/test-repos/spring-petclinic-semantic-cfg`. The runner must accept other paths at the same clean commits and must never modify either repository.

## Plan of Work

First publish `.agents/docs/semantic-artifact-lifecycle-matrix.md`. For every artifact in scope, state the owner and consumers, lifetime, complete cache key or identity inputs, invalidation behavior, hot representation, completeness admission rule, expected reuse, current observability, evidence, and decision. Include future summary artifacts as pending shapes, not implemented rows. Keep raw worklists, truncations, and witness paths explicitly ephemeral.

Next add `src/benchmark/artifact_lifecycle.rs` and re-export it from `src/benchmark/mod.rs`. Define validated public benchmark types:

    pub struct ArtifactPromotionThresholds {
        pub minimum_hydration_speedup_percent: f64,
        pub minimum_hydration_saved_ms: f64,
        pub maximum_hydration_rss_ratio: f64,
        pub maximum_serialized_to_hydrated_bytes_ratio: f64,
        pub maximum_build_write_time_ratio: f64,
        pub maximum_build_write_overhead_ms: f64,
    }

    pub struct ArtifactPromotionMeasurement {
        pub rebuild_ms: f64,
        pub build_write_ms: f64,
        pub hydrate_ms: f64,
        pub rebuild_peak_rss_bytes: Option<u64>,
        pub hydrate_peak_rss_bytes: Option<u64>,
        pub serialized_bytes: u64,
        pub estimated_hydrated_bytes: u64,
    }

    pub fn evaluate_artifact_promotion(
        thresholds: ArtifactPromotionThresholds,
        measurement: ArtifactPromotionMeasurement,
    ) -> Result<ArtifactPromotionEvaluation, ArtifactPromotionInputError>;

`ArtifactPromotionEvaluation` must retain calculated speedup/saving plus a typed status for every gate and compute aggregate `passed()` from those statuses. The error must distinguish invalid thresholds from invalid measurements. Ratios must be compared without overflowing byte multiplication. Floating values must be finite and nonnegative; rebuild time and estimated hydrated bytes must be greater than zero. RSS must be present and nonzero for both modes to pass the RSS gate.

Give `ArtifactPromotionThresholds::default()` the six existing #817 thresholds. Add focused unit tests for exact boundaries, one failure at a time, missing RSS, invalid floats, zero denominators, and large byte values.

Refactor `tests/measure_semantic_cfg_persistence.rs` to construct `ArtifactPromotionMeasurement` from its retained medians and use the shared evaluator. Keep its JSON gate fields and recommendation semantically unchanged so the historical aggregate remains comparable. Add an assertion that the shared default thresholds equal the values named by the benchmark report.

Then create `tests/measure_dataflow_lifecycle.rs`. The ignored test has a sample mode and an aggregate mode selected by environment, following the existing semantic benchmark conventions. It builds these datasets:

- deterministic generated TypeScript branch and call-chain projects at two bounded sizes;
- fixed inline TypeScript and Java call/branch/exception projects;
- pinned VS Code rooted at the unique semantic procedure `src/vs/base/common/arrays.ts::quickSelect`;
- pinned Spring PetClinic rooted at the unique semantic procedure `src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/OwnerController.java::processFindForm`.

Select external procedures structurally from their complete `SemanticArtifact` by exact relative path and final declaration name. Fail if selection is missing or ambiguous. Materialize the ICFG with explicit limits recorded in the output. Preserve any typed incomplete outcome instead of filtering it into an empty graph.

Run two benchmark-local clients over each available snapshot. The direct client uses the production `DirectFlowProblem`. The finite-fact client seeds fact one and emits the current fact plus its successor up to sixteen through every transfer family. It is deterministic, union-distributive, finite, and exists only to pressure reached-state growth; it is not a production analysis client.

Each sample reports Bifrost commit and dirty-tree fingerprint, toolchain/machine context, dataset repository identity, ICFG limits and outcome, semantic/ICFG construction time, first and immediate-repeat solve time, nodes, edges, boundaries, facts, reached rows, all five solver-work dimensions, termination, completeness, deterministic checksum, estimated shallow result bytes, peak RSS where supported, cache status `not_applicable_run_local`, and serialized size `not_applicable`.

The aggregate validates identical provenance, canonical typed-topology checksums, and work/result identity within each dataset/client group, retains rounds two through eight, computes medians, and emits the recommendation `ephemeral_not_eligible; persist reusable summaries only after #823 defines and measures them`. It must not pass the samples through the persistence gate because no equivalent serialized candidate was built.

Create `scripts/run-dataflow-lifecycle-benchmarks.sh`. It uses `set -euo pipefail`, validates the external roots and exact clean commits, creates one `mktemp -d` work directory, removes it on exit, runs nine release processes per dataset, retains seven sample JSON rows per dataset, runs aggregation, and prints exactly one `BIFROST_DATAFLOW_LIFECYCLE_BENCHMARK=` record. It sets `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off` and does not create a manually named Cargo target directory.

After collecting the retained matrix, write `.agents/docs/dataflow-lifecycle-benchmark-2026-07-24.md` with the exact command, Bifrost/toolchain/machine and dataset revisions, all retained samples or the aggregate’s raw-sample section, medians, counts, limits, memory observations, and recommendation. Update the lifecycle matrix and this plan with the measured evidence.

## Concrete Steps

Run all commands from `/Users/dave/.codex/worktrees/dc95/bifrost`.

Confirm the synchronized branch:

    git status --short --branch
    git rev-parse HEAD origin/master
    git rev-list --left-right --count HEAD...origin/master

Expected before issue edits: a clean worktree, attached #817 branch, and zero divergence from `origin/master`.

After the lifecycle matrix and ExecPlan are complete:

    git diff --check
    git status --short

Stage only those two files and commit a multiline checkpoint describing why unsupported artifact shapes remain unpersisted.

After adding the benchmark API and migrating the CFG gate:

    cargo fmt
    cargo test benchmark::artifact_lifecycle
    cargo test --test measure_semantic_cfg_persistence

Expected: the focused unit tests pass; the ignored release measurement remains ignored in the ordinary integration-test run; all non-ignored DTO and aggregation tests pass.

After adding the data-flow benchmark:

    cargo test --test measure_dataflow_lifecycle
    cargo test --test dataflow_tabulation --test dataflow_clients

Expected: benchmark schema/aggregation validation and all existing solver behaviors pass. The expensive measurement itself remains ignored.

Run the retained matrix:

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_TS_REPO=/Users/dave/Workspace/test-repos/vscode-semantic-cfg \
    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_JAVA_REPO=/Users/dave/Workspace/test-repos/spring-petclinic-semantic-cfg \
      scripts/run-dataflow-lifecycle-benchmarks.sh

Expected: the runner prints progress to stderr and exactly one aggregate JSON marker to stdout. Every group has rounds two through eight, stable checksums/counts, and an `ephemeral_not_eligible` recommendation.

Run formatting and strict lint:

    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

Run the complete feature-enabled suite on macOS:

    env RUSTFLAGS='-Clink-arg=-undefined -Clink-arg=dynamic_lookup' \
        BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off \
        scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh cargo test --features nlp,python

Expected: every enabled library, binary, integration, and doc-test target passes apart from repository-documented ignored tests. If the managed sandbox blocks helper subprocesses, rerun the exact command with host access and record both outcomes.

## Validation and Acceptance

The lifecycle matrix is accepted when every current promoted or measured semantic artifact has a named owner, lifetime, full identity inputs, invalidation behavior, representation, completeness rule, observability, evidence link, and explicit decision. Future summaries may be pending, but their required key dimensions and promotion prerequisites must be stated.

The gate API is accepted when the default evaluator exactly reproduces the six predeclared semantic CFG checks; all checks must pass for promotion; missing or invalid evidence cannot pass; and callers receive typed per-gate results suitable for JSON reporting.

The migrated CFG benchmark is accepted when its existing external-corpus decision remains a no-go for the same reason: VS Code build-plus-write absolute overhead exceeds 250 milliseconds.

The data-flow benchmark is accepted when all seven retained samples per group have stable topology, work, result, and checksum identity; first and repeated solves reach fixed points where the input ICFG is complete; incomplete ICFG input remains visibly incomplete; and every required provenance/count/time/memory field is present or explicitly unavailable.

The lifecycle decision is accepted when the report distinguishes repeated computation from cache reuse and leaves raw exploded states, worklists, truncations, and concrete results ephemeral. No SQLite migration, packed data-flow DTO, cache insertion, or durable dense `FactId` may be introduced.

Repository acceptance additionally requires formatting, strict all-target/all-feature Clippy, focused persistence/data-flow tests, and the complete `nlp,python` test matrix.

## Idempotence and Recovery

The benchmark runner is read-only with respect to source repositories and creates all samples in a unique temporary directory removed by its trap. Re-running it produces a new evidence record without changing tracked files. It validates exact external commits before doing expensive work.

The promotion evaluator is pure. Re-running an evaluation cannot change cache or database state. Invalid inputs return errors before computing a recommendation.

The CFG gate migration must preserve the old aggregate fields. If the shared evaluator changes the old decision, stop and fix the semantic mismatch rather than editing thresholds or expected output.

If an external procedure selector becomes ambiguous at the pinned revision, fix the structural selector to use its complete declaration locator; do not use source-text parsing or choose the first match. If an external repository is unavailable, generated and inline sample mode may be used for development, but the retained final matrix is incomplete until both exact pinned repositories run.

No new migration exists to roll back. Checkpoint commits are scoped by milestone. Do not stage unrelated files, push, or open a pull request.

## Artifacts and Notes

The lifecycle flow established by this checkpoint is:

    concrete complete artifact shape
                    |
          explicit identity and lifetime
                    |
       baseline + equivalent candidate samples
                    |
     all predeclared promotion gates pass?
              /                 \
           yes                   no
      versioned DTO         retain current owner
      + safe miss rules     + record measured no-go

Raw data-flow state exits before the candidate branch because it is query-owned:

    seeds + exact ICFG + client + budgets
                    |
        run-local facts/worklists/result
                    |
       ephemeral_not_eligible
                    |
     future reusable summary projection (#823)

- `.agents/plans/issue-820-bounded-dataflow-tabulation.md`

## Interfaces and Dependencies

The benchmark API uses only `std`, existing `serde` derives if JSON serialization is useful to callers, and the existing `src/benchmark` module. It adds no dependency.

`ArtifactPromotionThresholds::default()` is the stable #817 baseline for equivalent packed artifacts:

    speedup_percent >= 30.0
    saved_ms >= 50.0
    hydrate_rss / rebuild_rss <= 1.10
    serialized_bytes / estimated_hydrated_bytes <= 2.0
    build_write_ms / rebuild_ms <= 1.25
    build_write_ms - rebuild_ms <= 250.0

`ArtifactPromotionEvaluation` exposes measured speedup and saving, six typed gate outcomes, and aggregate `passed`. A gate outcome distinguishes `Passed`, `Failed`, and `Unavailable`; invalid numeric inputs are errors rather than gate outcomes.

The data-flow benchmark consumes only public production interfaces: `WorkspaceAnalyzer`, semantic materialization, `IcfgProvider`, `IcfgSnapshotLimits`, `IcfgSolveInput`, `DirectFlowProblem`, the finite `BoundedSnapshotDataflowProblem`, `SolverBudget`, `DataflowRequest`, and `solve`. It must not add a test-only public snapshot constructor.

Plan revision note (2026-07-24): Created the issue-specific lifecycle-foundation plan after synchronizing the existing #817 branch, verifying current issue/dependency state, and auditing the completed structural, semantic/CFG, oracle, ICFG, and first data-flow solver lifecycles. The scope intentionally standardizes evidence and measures request-local data-flow state without inventing summary persistence before #823.
