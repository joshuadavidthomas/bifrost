# Audit the five largest Java, Go, and Python corpora through the public symbols surface

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds. Maintain this document in accordance with `.agents/PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Bifrost's forward-vs-inverse reference differential asks a simple user-facing question: when the public symbols API resolves a source reference to a declaration, can the inverse usage query find that same source range again? Earlier work closed this campaign for one large Java, Go, and Python repository per language. This campaign expands coverage to the five largest valid local clones for each language, runs repositories concurrently within the 120-core and 98-GiB host budget, exhaustively distinguishes genuine analyzer defects from invalid forward identities or explicit limits, and fixes every genuine defect that is not already owned by somebody else.

The observable result is three complete JSONL corpus records, one per language and five repositories per record, produced by `bifrost_reference_differential run-corpus`. For each language, every raw `missing` site is either fixed and proven by an exact production rerun or documented with source evidence showing why it is not a valid actionable forward/inverse pair. Genuine defects receive GitHub issues assigned to `jbellis` before implementation. Each language ends with the complete feature-enabled local Cargo test suite passing, a direct integration to `origin/master`, issue evidence and closure, and a concise summary. GitHub CI is intentionally not a blocking gate for this campaign because the user asked the root session to move on once local `cargo test` passes.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-07-17 00:32Z) Fast-forwarded the clean detached Optane worktree to current `origin/master` at `1a37f639e5dc247eda66419482786c469759fbc3`, read `.agents/PLANS.md`, reconciled the canonical N=1 campaign, and reviewed the completed repository-concurrency plan.
- [x] (2026-07-17 00:32Z) Ran a read-only GPT-5.4/medium Oldskool research pass. It confirmed the clean N=1 closure boundaries and identified the dominant stale/false-forward families that must not be rediscovered as inverse bugs.
- [x] (2026-07-17 00:32Z) Repaired `/mnt/c/Users/jbell/.codex/agents/oldskool.toml` by adding the role's now-required `developer_instructions`; the initial invocation had warned that Codex ignored the malformed role, although explicit model/reasoning overrides still ran GPT-5.4/medium.
- [x] (2026-07-17 00:32Z) Built the release differential runner and selected the exact top five Java, Go, and Python clones with a no-write dry-run. All fifteen Git repositories are clean; three N=1 repositories and IntelliJ have existing persisted caches, while the other eleven are cold.
- [x] (2026-07-17 00:36Z) Committed and pushed the campaign-start plan as `2366ea0e`, establishing a clean published Bifrost checkpoint before analyzer cache mutation.
- [x] (2026-07-17 01:31Z) Completed the clean-head Java top-five baseline at `082570af` in 54m51s with all five repository jobs successful. The run averaged 829% CPU, peaked at 22.1 GiB RSS, and recorded raw missing counts of google-cloud-java 122, AWS SDK Java 126, IntelliJ 740, Dragonwell 200, and Telegram 344.
- [x] (2026-07-17 01:31Z) Confirmed Dragonwell `JapaneseImperialCalendar.java:414` bytes `16578..16582` as a live complete-inverse gap for `java.util.Calendar.YEAR`, searched for duplicates, created issue #858 assigned to `jbellis`, and delegated the structured fix plus reduced shadow controls to Oldskool. Root review removed an unnecessary whole-workspace edge-builder expansion and added public reference/location MCP coverage.
- [x] (2026-07-17 02:12Z) Exhaustively reconciled the remaining Java baseline rows. Google Cloud's 122 rows are invalid forward identities or incompatible focus spans; AWS's 126 split into 105 invalid constructor/receiver-focus rows and 21 live annotation sites; Telegram's 344 reduce to 328 qualifier/focus artifacts, two owner-focus rows, one wrong forward identity, and 13 live sites across annotation/varargs/inherited-field/constructor roots; Dragonwell's 200 reduce to inherited field, annotation, varargs/constructor roots plus invalid residuals; IntelliJ's 740 contain 538 test/testData forward contaminations, qualified-span/static-import/wrong-overload artifacts, and the live roots recorded below.
- [x] (2026-07-17 02:12Z) Searched open and closed GitHub issues, verified the old #486 was unrelated, and created issues #860 (expanded varargs), #861 (annotation references), #862 (constructor type references), and #863 (bare inherited method round trip), all assigned to `jbellis` before implementation. No issue assigned to another user was reused.
- [x] (2026-07-17 03:08Z) Reviewed and narrowed the delegated Java implementation: removed an unrelated explicit `this`/`super` constructor expansion, preserved ordinary type hit spans while adding annotation terminals, added subclass-field-shadow controls, invalidated stale Java declaration metadata with a per-language epoch salt, and generalized forward/inverse arity checks through structured `CallableArity` metadata including varargs.
- [x] (2026-07-17 03:08Z) Proved issues #858, #860, #861, and #862 against every retained production witness. Exact reruns are actionable-zero for Dragonwell `Calendar.YEAR`, Telegram `resourceProvider`, all four annotation repositories, Telegram/IntelliJ varargs calls, IntelliJ `JBList`/`ComboBox`/`TextRange` constructors, Telegram's anonymous-class constructor, and Dragonwell's diamond `Vector<>` constructor.
- [x] (2026-07-17 03:08Z) Corrected #863 after production review showed the two-argument IntelliJ `append(...)` call was first being resolved forward to a three-argument subclass override. Updated the assigned issue, delegated the forward fix to Oldskool, reviewed it to honor structured varargs arity, and obtained an actionable-zero exact round trip targeting the correct inherited `SimpleColoredComponent.append` declaration.
- [x] (2026-07-17 03:49Z) Completed root and independent Oldskool review. Root added current-class and nearest-ancestor override/field-shadow controls; Oldskool identified superclass-versus-interface method precedence, which now prefers the single declaring class at a hierarchy level and has a reduced regression. The complete focused suites pass: 58 Java usage-graph tests, 479 definition tests, and 148 public symbols-service tests with one intentional ignore.
- [x] (2026-07-17 03:55Z) Passed the Java integration gate: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and the complete `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache cargo test --features nlp,python` suite all exited zero. Post-review exact probes remained actionable-zero for Dragonwell `Calendar.YEAR` and the correctly resolved IntelliJ `SimpleColoredComponent.append` call.
- [x] (2026-07-17 05:15Z) Merged current `origin/master`, repeated the complete local gate successfully, and pushed the first Java fixing commit `02abec28` as integrated master `92c7dfa2`. The pushed-head five-repository confirmation then completed successfully in 56m57s: google-cloud-java 119 raw missing, AWS 53, IntelliJ 216, Dragonwell 172, and Telegram 314.
- [x] (2026-07-17 05:15Z) Delegated independent pushed-head residual reviews to Oldskool and root-reviewed exact source bytes. Google Cloud's 119 are 92 invalid class identities/focus spans plus 27 method owner/receiver-focus spans. AWS's 53 and Telegram's apparent qualified-call/varargs survivors focus class qualifiers rather than method selectors; issue #865 was created during provisional triage, assigned to `jbellis`, then closed unimplemented as invalid once the exact byte range proved the mismatch.
- [x] (2026-07-17 05:15Z) Exact production reruns isolated six still-live assigned roots: #858 inherited field writes (`VoiceStatus.active`), #860 annotated spread parameters (`JavaCompilerBundle.message` and `TokenSet.create`), #863 wrong-arity fallback when the matching inherited declaration is external (`JBList.repaint()`), #864 static imports with multiple wildcard owners plus static-import declaration ranges, #866 Java method references (`GridUtil::suggestPlugin`), and #867 bare inherited external fields resolving to same-name local methods (`GridBag.insets`). New issues #864, #866, and #867 were created assigned to `jbellis` before implementation; no other assignee owned a duplicate.
- [x] (2026-07-17 06:05Z) Reviewed and completed the delegated residual implementation. Java declarations recover annotated spread parameters from the grammar's structured `ERROR` subtree and bump only the Java epoch; forward lookup filters member kind and refuses wrong-arity local fallbacks; static-import candidate discovery understands source-owner files and unrelated wildcard owners; targeted and whole-workspace inverse paths cover method references; and class-body scopes prevent anonymous/nested fields from leaking into outer bare-field resolution.
- [x] (2026-07-17 06:12Z) Rebuilt both IntelliJ and Dragonwell persisted caches under the new Java epoch and exact-validated all seven final production witnesses. `Flags.FINAL`, `ChronoUnit.WEEKS`, `VoiceStatus.active`, annotated `JavaCompilerBundle.message`, and `GridUtil::suggestPlugin` now have exact covering inverse evidence; invalid `JBList.repaint()` and `GridBag.insets` forward identities now return honest `no_definition`. Every exact record has zero actionable findings.
- [x] (2026-07-17 06:18Z) Completed root and Oldskool review. Review added inherited-only `Child::baseMethod` method-reference controls to both public scan-usages and whole-workspace usage-graph paths. Formatting, all-target/all-feature Clippy, 481 definition tests, 63 targeted Java inverse tests, 19 whole-workspace Java graph tests, and the complete `cargo test --features nlp,python` gate all pass.
- [x] (2026-07-17 08:15Z) Completed the clean pushed-head Java top-five confirmation at `3bd7b75a` in 1h02m13s. The five concurrent jobs averaged 668% CPU and peaked at 14.5 GiB RSS; raw missing counts were google-cloud-java 116, AWS SDK Java 53, IntelliJ 190, Dragonwell 141, and Telegram 306.
- [x] (2026-07-17 08:42Z) Exhaustively triaged all 806 residual rows with independent Oldskool partitions and root byte/source review. AWS's 53 are qualifier-focus artifacts; Telegram has 303 qualifier/receiver-focus artifacts and three selector-accurate residuals; Google has 89 focus artifacts and 27 wrong forward type identities; IntelliJ plus Dragonwell have 221 focus mismatches, 60 default-package/test-fixture collisions, and 50 additional suspicious forward identities. Exact reruns reduced the legitimate residue to wrong Java type identity, `this`/`super` method references, and comment-inflated call arity.
- [x] (2026-07-17 09:02Z) Searched GitHub, created and assigned #868 (wrong default-package/scoped type identity) and #869 (commented multiline argument arity) to `jbellis` before implementation, and reused already-assigned #866 for `this::`/`super::` method references. No issue assigned to another user was touched.
- [x] (2026-07-17 09:34Z) Reviewed and completed delegated fixes. Packaged Java files can no longer fall back to default-package declarations; scoped type terminals resolve their structured full type and preserve external/workspace-package boundaries; nested lexical types beat imports in true type contexts; argument arity ignores tree-sitter extra/comment nodes; and method-reference receiver ownership maps `this`/`super` through the enclosing class and hierarchy.
- [x] (2026-07-17 09:50Z) Exact-validated eight production witnesses with zero actionable findings: IntelliJ `HashMap`, Dragonwell bare `type`, Telegram commented `ParserException` construction, Google fully qualified `Builder` and protobuf `Value`, Dragonwell `JCTree.Visitor`, and Telegram current/inherited `this::fillItems` and `this::setDarkGradientLocation`. The complete `cargo test --features nlp,python` suite, formatting check, and all-target/all-feature Clippy gate pass.
- [x] (2026-07-17 11:40Z) Committed the final Java fixes as `431f1292`, fetched current master, confirmed no merge was needed, and pushed directly to `origin/master`. All eight production exact witnesses reran from that clean pushed head with `bifrost_dirty=false` and zero actionable findings.
- [x] (2026-07-17 13:19Z) Completed the definitive clean-head Java top-five run in 1h38m48s at 524% average CPU and 16.5 GiB peak RSS. Final raw missing counts are google-cloud-java 90, AWS 53, IntelliJ 149, Dragonwell 121, and Telegram 188; all five repository records report `431f1292`, `bifrost_dirty=false`, and successful completion.
- [x] (2026-07-17 13:28Z) Exhaustively audited all 601 final Java raw rows with independent per-repository Oldskool partitions and root review. Every row is a receiver/qualifier/non-terminal scoped-type focus mismatch, an inferred receiver-to-class projection, or a same-FQN test-fixture collision. Zero final rows select the actual member/type terminal represented by the forward target, so zero legitimate Java defects remain.
- [x] (2026-07-17 13:28Z) Completed the Java top-five run, triaged every raw missing site, filed/assigned/fixed every legitimate issue, passed the complete local gate, integrated to `origin/master`, reran from the fixing head, and prepared issue closure evidence and the Java summary.
- [x] (2026-07-17 13:32Z) Started the Go top-five run with five repository jobs and twenty-four workers each. The deterministic Kubernetes sample reached forward file 533/699 before a reference-differential worker overflowed its stack; the `tee` pipeline masked the signal-6 abort, so root verified the missing JSONL artifact and durable log rather than accepting the pipeline status.
- [x] (2026-07-17 13:37Z) Searched GitHub for duplicates, found no matching open or closed issue, created #875 assigned to `jbellis`, and delegated the narrow diagnosis/implementation to Oldskool. Root reproduced Kubernetes under GDB and captured infinite mutual recursion between `go_expression_type_text` and `go_range_binding_type_fqn` when a range element shadows its iterable.
- [x] (2026-07-17 13:44Z) Reviewed the #875 implementation: range RHS inference now uses `right.start_byte()`, so the newly declared range variable is not visible while its iterable is evaluated. Added a public location-definition regression for `for _, history := range history` that still resolves `history.Revision` through the element type.
- [x] (2026-07-17 13:49Z) Proved #875 on the exact production boundary. The same Kubernetes 10,000-site run now completes 699/699 forward files and 1,000/1,000 inverse targets in 33.9s instead of aborting. Formatting, all-target/all-feature Clippy, all Go definition tests, and the complete `cargo test --features nlp,python` suite pass.
- [x] (2026-07-17 14:11Z) Merged concurrent `origin/master`, repeated the complete feature-enabled local gate, pushed the #875 fix as integrated head `545b2a17`, attached the exact Kubernetes proof, and closed #875. The definitive clean-head Go top-five run then completed all five repositories in 4m29s at 579% average CPU and 9.1 GiB peak RSS.
- [x] (2026-07-17 14:29Z) Exhaustively partitioned all 1,237 clean-head Go raw missing rows with disjoint Oldskool repository reviews plus root byte/source checks. AWS's 126 are 117 focus/partial-chain rows and nine wrong-owner labels; gcloud-golang's 190 are 160 focus/partial-chain rows, four wrong-owner labels, and declaration roles; google-cloud-go's 178 add two genuine nested-module misses; Loki's 162 include 59 focus rows, 36 explicit partial/declaration diagnostics, 55 wrong-forward composite labels, nine elided labels, two map-key constants, and one nested-module miss; Kubernetes's 581 include 301 focus rows, 32 wrong-forward identities, 227 nested-module misses, seven map-key constants, and 14 elided labels.
- [x] (2026-07-17 14:33Z) Searched open and closed GitHub issues, found no owned duplicates, and created #876 (nested Go modules), #877 (constant expressions as map keys), #878 (nested elided composite labels), and #879 (wrong forward owner for composite labels), all assigned to `jbellis` before implementation. Explicit `partial_selector_chain` outcomes remain documented best-effort diagnostics rather than false inverse targets.
- [x] (2026-07-17 14:49Z) Reviewed the delegated structured fixes. Inverse module routing now reuses the cached multi-module `GoWorkspacePathIndex`; map keys fall through as ordinary expressions; elided literal owners propagate through array/slice element and map value AST edges; and public location-definition lookup resolves keyed labels from the exact local or imported owner while refusing same-name guesses. Root caught and corrected the initial forward patch's unhandled tree-sitter `literal_element` wrapper and added a two-level nested-array control.
- [x] (2026-07-17 14:55Z) Proved all four assigned roots on dirty production code with actionable-zero exact reruns: google-cloud-go `ReorderFirewallPoliciesResponse` through the nested Recaptcha module, gcloud `Options3LO.TokenURL`, Loki `StageTypeLabel`, Loki elided `FromTo.From`, and Loki nested `likelyScriptRegion.script`. Formatting, all-target/all-feature Clippy, the public forward regression, and all 53 targeted Go inverse tests pass.
- [x] (2026-07-17 15:20Z) Completed the full local gate after the host `fs.inotify.max_user_instances` limit was raised from 128 to 1024. The previously blocked persisted-service watcher test passes, and the complete `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache cargo test --features nlp,python` run exits zero end to end.
- [ ] Complete the Go top-five run under the same discipline and publish the Go summary.
- [ ] Complete the Python top-five run under the same discipline and publish the Python summary.
- [ ] Reconcile the final canonical campaign evidence, record outcomes and limitations, and leave the Optane worktree clean.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: The configured Oldskool role existed but was not valid under the current Codex schema.
  Evidence: the first delegated invocation reported that `/mnt/c/Users/jbell/.codex/agents/oldskool.toml` must define `developer_instructions`. Explicit `-m gpt-5.4 -c model_reasoning_effort=\"medium\"` overrides still produced a completed read-only handoff, and the role file now includes the missing field.

- Observation: Eleven of the fifteen selected repositories are genuinely cold, rather than merely having small caches.
  Evidence: only `googleapis__google-cloud-java` (5.8 GiB), `JetBrains__intellij-community` (987 MiB), `aws__aws-sdk-go-v2` (1.6 GiB), and `googleapis__google-cloud-python` (1.5 GiB) currently have `.brokk` directories. The other selected clones report no cache.

- Observation: The Python corpus metadata selects two strongly polyglot repositories, `tektoncd__operator` and `kubevirt__kubevirt`, because their recorded Python LOC ranks fourth and fifth among available valid clones.
  Evidence: selection is metadata-driven and deterministic; the dry-run reported 2,156,538 and 2,151,738 Python LOC respectively. Do not replace them manually with repositories that merely look more Python-centric.

- Observation: The N=1 closure records contain many raw missing rows that are not genuine inverse defects.
  Evidence: final Java retained 122 rows partitioned into 92 invalid class forward identities and 30 owner/receiver-focus method rows; final Go retained 126 invalid rows partitioned into 117 incompatible focus/target identities and nine wrong-owner keyed labels; final Python retained six invalid rows consisting of one wrong receiver identity and five post-rebind wrong-import identities.

- Observation: Repository-level concurrency removed the multi-repository serial wait, but Java remained storage/kernel dominated rather than CPU saturated.
  Evidence: five `--jobs 24` analyzers completed in 54m51s at 829% average aggregate CPU, with 9,069 user seconds, 18,244 system seconds, 28,701 major faults, and 287,246,208 filesystem output blocks. Fast repositories entered inverse scanning while AWS and google-cloud-java were still in forward resolution, so the outer scheduler behaved concurrently as designed.

- Observation: A raw IntelliJ type-use row that looked like an inverse miss was actually a wrong forward identity.
  Evidence: `com.google.common.graph.@NotNull MutableNetwork` in `GraphAdapter.java` resolved forward to the unrelated workspace declaration `com.intellij.util.graph.MutableNetwork`. It is not evidence for broadening inverse type matching.

- Observation: Java's precise inverse field scan recognized bare fields only in the declaration owner itself or through static imports, while the forward resolver already follows inherited fields.
  Evidence: the exact Dragonwell rerun resolved `YEAR` to `java.util.Calendar.YEAR` and returned one missing site with one fully queried target. The reduced `p.Child extends p.Base` case failed before the patch and passes after using hierarchy-aware owner context while rejecting nested-scope local and parameter shadows.

- Observation: The ordinary-constructor rows had two independent structured causes; the first delegated hypothesis that selector grouping or candidate-file scope caused them was disproved.
  Evidence: refreshed persisted metadata alone left IntelliJ `new ExpandedItemListCellRendererWrapper<>(...)` missing. Temporary exact-path diagnostics showed `generic_type` reached the constructor matcher but `expression_name_node` returned no terminal for diamond syntax. Falling back to the generic node's first named type child fixes diamond constructors. Separately, non-generic IntelliJ `new TextRange(...)` and Telegram anonymous-class construction became consistent only after Java declarations emitted structured callable arity and the Java epoch forced stale metadata to refresh.

- Observation: The apparent inherited-method inverse miss in IntelliJ was initially preceded by an invalid forward overload identity.
  Evidence: the source call `append("'", SimpleTextAttributes.GRAY_ATTRIBUTES)` has two arguments, while baseline forward resolution selected `ColoredListCellRenderer.append(String, SimpleTextAttributes, boolean)`. Arity-aware forward hierarchy traversal now continues to `SimpleColoredComponent.append(String, SimpleTextAttributes)`, after which hierarchy-aware inverse matching covers the original call. The final exact rerun is actionable-zero.

- Observation: Java cache invalidation is expensive once but warm exact probes are cheap.
  Evidence: the first post-epoch refresh took about 354 seconds for IntelliJ, 364 seconds for Dragonwell, and 564 seconds for AWS at 40-120 workers. Subsequent exact probes on the same repository loaded the workspace in roughly 2-45 seconds and completed in 5-69 seconds.

- Observation: Nearest-declaring-owner logic must preserve Java's class-over-interface precedence.
  Evidence: independent Oldskool review found that a superclass and directly implemented interface can declare the same method signature at the same breadth-first hierarchy level, while Java resolves a bare call to the superclass member. The inverse matcher now prefers a single declaring class over same-level interfaces, remains conservative for multiple interface declarations, and the inherited-method reduction exercises `Child extends Base implements Pingable`.

- Observation: A raw exact-run `actionable=1` is still not sufficient when the audited byte range focuses a qualifier instead of the selector returned by inverse usage.
  Evidence: AWS `MarshallingInfo.builder`, Telegram `LocaleController.formatPluralString`, `AndroidUtilities.runOnUIThread`, and `Theme.getColor` all reran as raw missing, but their exact ranges cover `MarshallingInfo`, `LocaleController`, `AndroidUtilities`, or `Theme`. Root byte slicing prevented an incorrect inverse broadening and led to closing provisional #865 without code.

- Observation: The first Java fixes materially reduced raw missing counts but changed which previously skipped targets entered the 1,000-target inverse sample.
  Evidence: baseline to pushed-head raw counts moved google 122 to 119, AWS 126 to 53, IntelliJ 740 to 216, Dragonwell 200 to 172, and Telegram 344 to 314. Newly visible selector-accurate rows exposed annotated varargs, static imports, method references, external-inheritance fallback, and wrong-kind forward identities that were inconclusive or unsampled in the baseline.

- Observation: Java's tree-sitter grammar represents a type-use annotation between a varargs element type and ellipsis as an `ERROR` child of the formal-parameter list.
  Evidence: fresh inline analysis produces the correct `(String, Object[])` signature and required/total/repeated arity only after walking that structured error subtree; the persisted IntelliJ witness remained `(String)` until a Java-only epoch bump rebuilt it, then returned an exact consistent hit.

- Observation: Java local inference needs a scope boundary for every class body, including anonymous classes.
  Evidence: Dragonwell `SoftVoice` contains an anonymous controller field named `active` before the outer inherited `VoiceStatus.active` write. Without a class-body scope the anonymous field leaked into the outer scan; the production-shaped reduction now preserves that inner shadow while proving the later inherited write.

- Observation: Java's remaining top-five residuals exposed forward identity defects more often than inverse omissions.
  Evidence: packaged consumers could select unrelated default-package types, and a terminal identifier inside `scoped_type_identifier` could be resolved independently of its structured owner. The fixes preserve an honest external boundary and distinguish a missing type inside an existing workspace package from an unrelated same-name declaration.

- Observation: tree-sitter comments are named extra nodes and therefore cannot be counted as call arguments.
  Evidence: Telegram's multiline `ParserException(...)` call contained a comment between arguments; filtering argument-list children by both `is_named()` and `!is_extra()` restored the correct overload identity and inverse round trip.

- Observation: Java method-reference receiver ownership needs explicit structured handling for `this` and `super`.
  Evidence: `this::fillItems` and inherited `this::setDarkGradientLocation` both resolved forward but were absent from inverse results until the method-reference owner was derived from `ClassRangeIndex`; wrong-owner and overload-ambiguous controls remain rejected.

- Observation: A successful shell pipeline status did not mean the first Go campaign succeeded.
  Evidence: `time ... 2>&1 | tee ...` returned zero because `tee` exited normally, but the durable log ends with a Rust worker stack overflow and signal 6, and no JSONL output exists. Acceptance checks must verify both the expected artifact and repository record count; later campaign commands should preserve the producer's status with `pipefail` or avoid relying on the pipeline exit code.

- Observation: Go range-variable type inference used the member-reference byte when evaluating the range RHS.
  Evidence: GDB shows unbounded alternating frames in `go_expression_type_text` and `go_range_binding_type_fqn` for source shapes such as `for _, history := range history`. Evaluating the iterable at `right.start_byte()` restores Go scope order, keeps range element typing precise, and lets the exact Kubernetes sample complete.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Process languages in the requested Java, Go, Python order and establish a clean published checkpoint after each language.
  Rationale: The user requested a summary and master integration after each completed language. This also prevents one language's unresolved experiments from contaminating the next language's Bifrost metadata or corpus records.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Run one language at a time with `--repo-jobs 5 --jobs 24` rather than running all fifteen repositories together.
  Rationale: Five times twenty-four uses the host's 120 logical processors without deliberately oversubscribing analyzer construction. Language staging keeps triage and cache behavior understandable, bounds aggregate memory, and provides the required integration boundary after each language.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Use the persisted cache mode and never delete existing `.brokk` directories.
  Rationale: The campaign is intentionally resumable and measures the real symbols-tool path, including cold population and warm reuse. Eleven cold repositories will create new caches; existing N=1 caches contain valuable completed population work.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Treat only a valid forward identity plus a complete, non-truncated inverse query with no covering proven or unproven hit as a candidate defect.
  Rationale: A forward resolver can focus an owner, receiver, qualifier, wrong overload, wrong module, or ambiguous declaration. Fixing the inverse query to agree with that invalid identity would make the public symbols API less correct. Explicit file, candidate, target, or usage limits are honest inconclusive boundaries rather than defects.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Delegate broad source inspection, missing-row clustering, reduced-boundary research, and substantial synchronous implementations to the Oldskool GPT-5.4/medium role, while the root session alone owns the plan, issue mutations, acceptance decisions, review, local gates, commits, merges, pushes, and issue closure.
  Rationale: This matches the user's requested division of labor and allows independent research/implementation to overlap safe root work without delegating authority over GitHub or final correctness judgments.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Do not wait for GitHub CI after a language push.
  Rationale: The user explicitly asked the campaign to move on after local `cargo test` passes and will report CI failures separately. Local formatting, clippy, focused tests, and the full `cargo test --features nlp,python` suite remain mandatory before integration.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Bump only Java's analysis epoch when adding structured callable arity metadata.
  Rationale: persisted Java declarations from the same package version deserialize the new field as absent and would silently retain exact-only arity behavior, defeating varargs correctness. A Java-only salt refreshes the affected payloads without invalidating Go, Python, or unrelated language caches.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

The Java leg is complete on clean pushed head `431f1292c90cb0d63c97896a35a53404c031d87d`. The definitive run `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/java-top5-431f1292.jsonl` completed five concurrent repositories in 1h38m48s at 524% average CPU and 16.5 GiB peak RSS. Each repository sampled 10,000 sites. Google resolved 2,701 sites and classified 1,058 consistent, 37 editor-only, 44 unproven, 8,771 inconclusive, and 90 raw missing; AWS resolved 4,689 and classified 1,650/71/16/8,210/53; IntelliJ resolved 4,250 and classified 1,333/227/47/8,244/149; Dragonwell resolved 5,643 and classified 1,212/90/26/8,551/121; Telegram resolved 4,678 and classified 1,088/39/25/8,660/188. Exhaustive byte-level review accounts for all 601 raw rows as non-terminal receiver/qualifier focus mismatches, inferred receiver-class projections, or invalid same-FQN test-fixture identities, leaving zero genuine residual defects.

The Java top-five campaign found and fixed issues #858, #860, #861, #862, #863, #864, #866, #867, #868, and #869 across integrated commits `92c7dfa2`, `3bd7b75a`, and `431f1292`. The final commit adds honest packaged/default/scoped type boundaries, comment-safe callable arity, and `this`/`super` method-reference ownership; earlier checkpoints cover inherited fields/calls, annotations, constructors, varargs, static imports, wrong-kind fallback, and qualified method references. Eight pushed-head production exact records are actionable-zero, the complete `cargo test --features nlp,python` suite passes, formatting and all-target/all-feature Clippy pass, and GitHub CI was not awaited by instruction. Go and Python remain pending.

## Context and Orientation

Work in `/mnt/optane/tmp/bifrost-java-n10`. The worktree is detached by design but pushes `HEAD:master` directly, following the repository rule not to create branches or pull requests. Before every push, fetch `origin/master`; if it advanced, merge it with `git merge --no-edit origin/master`, never rebase. Stage only files changed for this campaign.

The command-line driver is `src/bin/bifrost_reference_differential.rs`. `run-corpus` reads corpus metadata below `/home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench/sft-tools-commits`, validates clones below `/home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench/clones` (a symlink to `/mnt/T9/repo-clones`), chooses repositories by descending recorded `code_loc`, and writes one JSON object per completed repository. `--repo-jobs` limits concurrent repository analyzers. `--jobs` limits both analyzer construction and the per-repository forward-file/inverse-target Rayon pool. Jobs sharing one canonical clone root are grouped and serialized, and one caller thread appends completed JSON records so interruption remains resumable.

The differential implementation is `src/reference_differential/mod.rs`. It samples at most 1,000 language files and 10,000 structured reference candidates per repository, resolves each sampled site forward through the analyzer, groups stable declaration identities, and asks the inverse usage path for the supplied source range. The word `missing` is a raw classification, not automatically a product bug. A `consistent` site has a covering proven inverse hit. `unproven` means the inverse returned the covering range but could not prove precise semantic identity. `inconclusive` covers missing forward identity, external boundaries, explicit limits, errors, or incompatible evidence. An actionable defect is a raw missing row that survives source and identity triage.

The acceptance surface is the MCP `symbols` toolset and its corresponding Rust and Python APIs: location/reference definition lookup, symbol search, summaries, and reference-based usage scans. LSP shares analyzer code and must keep passing, but editor protocol behavior is not the campaign focus. Reduced tests should therefore prefer the shared `tests/common/inline_project.rs` harness, language usage-graph tests, definition tests when forward identity is wrong, and public searchtools/Python bindings tests only when the exposed symbols behavior changes.

The prior authoritative N=1 closures are recorded in `.agents/plans/reference-differential-corpus.md`. Java's final clean google-cloud-java record is `/mnt/optane/tmp/java-n1-final-5440d102-j120.jsonl`; Go's AWS record is `/tmp/go-n1-91cddbf2.jsonl`; Python's google-cloud-python record is `/tmp/python-n1-6d6d76f3.jsonl`. Older baseline counts are stale leads only. The top-five campaign must rerun current code and may reuse known residual shapes only after comparing exact path, range, target identity, and diagnostics.

## Plan of Work

First commit and push this plan so the release runner and Bifrost repository metadata are both clean and published. Rebuild the release runner after that checkpoint. For Java, invoke `run-corpus` with the exact language filter, five repositories, five outer jobs, twenty-four inner jobs, persisted caches, the full N=1 limits, and an output under `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential`. Redirect stderr to a durable adjacent log while retaining interactive progress. Do not run any other analyzer process against these five clones until the command exits. The JSONL writer appends each repository immediately, so a stopped command can be repeated without `--force` and will skip completed semantic keys.

After the five repository records complete, extract every raw missing site grouped by repository and target kind. Preserve the report's exact `path`, `start_byte`, `end_byte`, `text`, `source_evidence`, `targets`, `note`, and `diagnostics`. Delegate disjoint repository clusters to Oldskool read-only passes. Root review checks the actual source bytes, confirms the forward declaration group is semantically valid, verifies inverse limits are complete, and compares known N=1 false-forward families. For suspicious sites, run exact `run-repo` commands against only that path/range on the same clean Bifrost head. The exact rerun must reproduce before any reduction.

Reduce each surviving defect with `InlineTestProject`. Put inverse-only boundaries in `tests/usages_java_graph_test.rs`, `tests/usages_go_graph_test.rs`, or `tests/usages_python_graph_test.rs`; whole-workspace graph differences belong in the corresponding `tests/usage_graph_*_test.rs`; forward identity defects belong in `tests/get_definition_test.rs` or the focused language analyzer/FQN suites. Include strong negative cases for wrong packages/modules, owners/receivers, overload/signature arity, imports/aliases, lexical shadowing/rebinding, nested scopes, duplicate physical declarations, and external imports as relevant. Use tree-sitter nodes, persisted declarations, import binders, and analyzer structures only. Never repair a structured gap with regex, substring search, delimiter scanning, or a source-text mini-parser.

Only after a behavior-focused reduction fails should root search open and closed GitHub issues with the production symbol/FQN, language, and root-boundary terms from the reduction. Inspect assignees before mutation. If an existing issue has an assignee other than `jbellis`, record it as skipped and do not work on it. If a reusable issue is unassigned, assign it only to `jbellis` before implementation. Otherwise create a new issue assigned to `jbellis` whose body includes the exact production site, differential evidence, reduced failing behavior, scope, and acceptance criteria. The root session performs every assignment and issue mutation.

Delegate the substantial implementation to a synchronous Oldskool GPT-5.4/medium subagent with the issue and reduced test as its contract. Root review inspects every diff, runs focused tests, rejects structured-correctness shortcuts, adds missing negative coverage, and retains ownership of edits needed to finish the fix. Repeat exact production probes on the dirty tree only as provisional evidence.

When no genuine sites remain for the language, run formatting, all-target/all-feature clippy, affected focused suites, and the complete `cargo test --features nlp,python` gate with `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache`. Update this living plan and the canonical campaign plan with baseline/final counts and evidence. Commit only relevant files with a multiline why-oriented message. Fetch and merge current `origin/master`, rerun at least formatting, focused tests, and the complete Cargo test if the merge touched analyzer code, then push `HEAD:master` directly. Do not wait for CI.

Rebuild the release runner from the pushed head. Exact-rerun every fixed production site and then rerun the complete language top-five command into the same JSONL; the changed Bifrost head makes those records distinct. Exhaustively triage the final raw missing rows. Comment on each assigned issue with the fixing commit, pushed Bifrost head, exact production evidence, and local test results, then close it. Publish the requested language summary and move to the next language only when the final five-repository record has zero genuine actionable defects.

Repeat the same lifecycle for Go and then Python. Do not carry dirty code, uncommitted plan changes, active analyzer processes, or unreviewed Oldskool edits across a language boundary.

## Concrete Steps

From `/mnt/optane/tmp/bifrost-java-n10`, verify and build the clean checkpoint:

    git status --short
    git rev-parse HEAD
    git rev-parse origin/master
    cargo build --release --bin bifrost_reference_differential

Use this command shape for each language, substituting `LANG` and a clean `BIFROST_HEAD`. `LANG` is `java`, `go`, or `py`:

    mkdir -p /mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential
    /usr/bin/time -v target/release/bifrost_reference_differential run-corpus \
      --clones-root /home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench/clones \
      --commits-root /home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench/sft-tools-commits \
      --language LANG \
      --repos-per-language 5 \
      --repo-jobs 5 \
      --jobs 24 \
      --cache-mode persisted \
      --max-files 1000 \
      --max-sites 10000 \
      --max-candidates-per-file 50000 \
      --max-source-bytes 4194304 \
      --max-targets 1000 \
      --max-usage-files 1000 \
      --max-usages 100000 \
      --seed 0 \
      --output /mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/LANG-top5.jsonl \
      2>&1 | tee /mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/LANG-top5-BIFROST_HEAD.log

Do not use `--include-tests`. Do not use `--force` unless intentionally repeating the same repository head, Bifrost head, and fingerprint after proving that the existing record is invalid. The pipeline above must be run outside the filesystem sandbox because it writes persisted caches below `/mnt/T9`.

Extract summaries and raw missing rows with structured JSON queries:

    jq -c 'select(.record_type == "repository") | {repo_slug,repo_head,bifrost_head,elapsed_seconds,summary:.report.summary}' \
      /mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/LANG-top5.jsonl

    jq -c 'select(.record_type == "repository") as $r | $r.report.sites[] | select(.classification == "missing") | {repo_slug:$r.repo_slug,path,start_byte,end_byte,line,text,source_evidence,targets,note,diagnostics}' \
      /mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/LANG-top5.jsonl

An exact reproduction uses `run-repo` with the selected clone, language, exact relative path and byte range, persisted mode, twenty-four jobs, and a fresh `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/LANG-exact-SLUG-BIFROST_HEAD.jsonl` output. Preserve all report fields; do not infer identity from rendered text alone.

Before each language push, run at minimum:

    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache cargo test --features nlp,python --test get_definition_test
    UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache cargo test --features nlp,python --test usages_LANG_graph_test
    UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache cargo test --features nlp,python --test usage_graph_LANG_test
    UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache cargo test --features nlp,python

The Java whole-workspace binary is `usage_graph_java_test`; Go is `usage_graph_go_test`; Python is `usage_graph_python_test`. If a named target is absent, inspect `tests/` and use the actual corresponding target rather than silently skipping equivalent coverage. Run all commands outside the restricted Optane sandbox when Python sidecars or process-tree tests require it. Follow `scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh` only for deliberately isolated validation; do not create manually named Cargo target directories under `/tmp`.

GitHub issue discipline uses the `gh` CLI. Search both states, inspect assignees, assign before code, and skip other owners. The representative sequence is:

    gh issue list --repo BrokkAi/bifrost --state all --search 'LANG ROOT_BOUNDARY' --limit 100
    gh issue view NUMBER --repo BrokkAi/bifrost --json number,title,state,assignees,body,url
    gh issue edit NUMBER --repo BrokkAi/bifrost --add-assignee jbellis

For a new issue, use `gh issue create --repo BrokkAi/bifrost --assignee jbellis`. After the pushed-head proof, add a comment and close with `gh issue close NUMBER --repo BrokkAi/bifrost --comment ...`. Never assign or close an issue through the delegated subagent.

## Validation and Acceptance

A language is complete only when exactly five selected repositories have completed records on the final pushed Bifrost head, all raw missing rows have an explicit reviewed disposition, and zero genuine actionable defects remain. A genuine fixed site must have a reduced behavior test that failed before the change, focused and full local gates that pass after it, and a clean pushed-head exact production record with a covering inverse hit or a correct honest non-actionable classification. Issues must be assigned only to `jbellis`, include the fixing commit and production proof, and be closed. An issue already assigned to another user is a documented skip, not authorization to alter their work.

The final local integration gate is `cargo test --features nlp,python`; a featureless `cargo test` is insufficient because it omits NLP-gated integration targets. Formatting and all-target/all-feature clippy must also pass. GitHub CI status is not part of the blocking acceptance criterion for this run, per the user's explicit instruction.

The campaign is complete when Java, Go, and Python each meet that language boundary, the plan contains three summaries and all issue/fix evidence, `origin/master` contains every accepted change, and the worktree has no campaign changes left uncommitted.

## Idempotence and Recovery

`run-corpus` is append-only and resume-safe. It derives a completion key from language, repository slug/head, Bifrost head, and configuration fingerprint. Repeating the same command without `--force` skips completed repositories and runs only missing keys. Records can arrive in completion order; JSONL line order is not semantic. Keep the output and log on Optane so `/tmp` cleanup or tmpfs pressure cannot erase long-run evidence.

If the process stops, first confirm no `bifrost_reference_differential` process still owns a selected clone, then repeat the same command. Never delete a clone's `.brokk` cache as a retry strategy. If a cache migration fails, inspect the error and database ownership; preserve the database for diagnosis. If a Bifrost code change occurs during a run, let already-running work finish only when the exact binary/head is known and the source tree remains stable; otherwise stop and rerun from a clean published head. Never combine records from different Bifrost heads when claiming a final language closure.

Oldskool research tasks must be read-only when they overlap a corpus run. Implementation delegation begins only after the analyzer command has stopped and a reduced failing test exists. Root review must discard or revise unproven edits before starting another analyzer against the affected clone.

## Artifacts and Notes

The host has 120 logical processors, 98 GiB RAM, 255 GiB swap, about 816 GiB free on `/mnt/optane`, about 816 GiB free on `/mnt/T9`, and about 901 GiB free on `/tmp` at campaign start. The concurrency product is exactly 120 configured workers, but aggregate CPU may stay below 12,000% because database work, filesystem latency, language-specific serial sections, and unequal repository completion create idle intervals. Wall-clock and RSS are evidence, not fixed performance requirements.

The initial dry-run skipped metadata members with invalid `code_loc`, a missing Java OpenAPI Generator clone, and a missing PyTorch clone before selecting the fifteen repositories listed above. Those skips are expected input validation and do not reduce the requested count because five valid clones remain for each language.

The Oldskool read-only handoff identified useful duplicate-search families. Java terms include nested return declaring scope, usage-facts full scan, generic signature arity, overload arity, static nested imports, duplicate physical source FQN identity, self-type references, and class-body initializer owners. Go terms include exact-owner keyed struct literal labels, composite literal wrong owner, selector focus/receiver, and ServiceID/DiscoverEndpoint owner identity. Python terms include module qualifier usage, re-export aliases, nested class ownership, source-ordered binding, deferred-body final binding, post-rebind imports, wrong receiver columns, and stdlib/workspace module collisions. These are search hints, not proof that a new top-five row is a duplicate.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

No campaign feature is planned up front; production edits are determined by reduced defects. Preserve the existing CLI contract in `src/bin/bifrost_reference_differential.rs`: `--repo-jobs` is outer repository concurrency, `--jobs` is per-repository analyzer and audit parallelism, output is append-only JSONL, and progress is repository-qualified. Preserve the report schema and stable declaration identity in `src/reference_differential/mod.rs` so records remain comparable.

Analyzer fixes must operate through the existing structured Java, Go, or Python analyzers and public symbols APIs. Rust tests should use `InlineTestProject` from `tests/common/inline_project.rs`. Python binding behavior is tested through the existing Python integration targets with `--features python` included via the full feature gate. Do not introduce new crates, persistence schemas, or public API shapes unless the reduced root cause genuinely requires them and the plan is revised first with the reason.

Revision note (2026-07-17 00:32Z): Created this self-contained top-five campaign plan after reconciling the completed N=1 Java/Go/Python evidence, validating the new repository-concurrency runner, repairing the Oldskool role schema, pinning all fifteen selected clone heads, and measuring cache/disk/host readiness. It records the user's issue ownership, delegation, local-test, per-language integration, and no-CI-wait requirements before any analyzer mutation.

Revision note (2026-07-17 00:36Z): Recorded the published campaign-start checkpoint so later corpus evidence can distinguish planning state from analyzer/fix heads.
