# Clean and evaluate the CodeScaleBench grep-hard set

This ExecPlan is a living document. Maintain it according to `.agents/PLANS.md` in the Bifrost repository.

## Purpose / Big Picture

This work will produce a valid CodeScaleBench comparison for Bifrost symbol and semantic tools. The current 67-task `grep_hard` list has scoring and output-contract problems. The prior Bifrost arms are invalid because every Bifrost MCP server failed before it exposed tools. After this work, the dataset will score equivalent repository names and valid answer shapes consistently. A Bifrost-free Luna run will identify tasks that remain difficult with grep. The same shovel-ready tasks will then run with symbols and with symbols plus NLP. Each Bifrost arm must prove that Bifrost started and returned valid tool results.

If Luna does not use semantic search often enough, the final NLP arm will add a synthetic step zero. A small query model will produce only necessary initial queries. The harness will run those queries before Luna starts. Luna will not see the query-model turn, but it will receive the semantic results.

- [x] (2026-08-06 00:31Z) Replaced the false 20-task cache set with 11 valid baseline failures and prewarmed all 11 against schema 15.
- [x] (2026-08-06 00:31Z) Fixed persistent prewarm, ordered active membership, one-pass active chunk loading, and canonical container workspace paths.
- [x] (2026-08-06 01:03Z) Stopped the first corrected symbol arm after a warm Kafka symbol call waited 71 seconds.
- [x] (2026-08-06 01:20Z) Grouped generator rules by language, moved trigger tests before enclosing-symbol lookup, and evaluated files in parallel.
- [x] (2026-08-06 01:22Z) Added shipped semantic-model activation to the CodeScale prewarm profiler.
- [x] (2026-08-06 01:47Z) Refreshed all 11 paired tasks with schema-3 readiness records for the current profiler.
- [x] (2026-08-06 01:55Z) Stopped the second symbol arm after one source call took 92 seconds and three exceeded two minutes.
- [x] (2026-08-06 02:05Z) Routed structured suffix lookup through the indexed terminal identifier before its table-scan fallback.
- [x] (2026-08-06 02:13Z) Built runtime r9 and started the corrected symbol arm.

- [x] (2026-08-06 03:45Z) Filed Bifrost issue #1690 and bounded each complete-file tree-sitter parse to ten seconds.
- [x] (2026-08-06 04:20Z) Versioned immutable prewarm records by profiler identity in Brokkbench commit `9c7102391c5`.
- [x] (2026-08-06 05:25Z) Rescored all 64 baseline archives with the corrected answer contract. The result is 39 scorable tasks, 25 invalid outputs, and 2 solves. The rescore report is `baseline-rescore-v2.json` in the campaign directory.
- [x] (2026-08-06 05:28Z) Started a sequential host-only DW10 prewarm for the 18 unique source revisions used by the 20-task near-miss set. No evaluation container performs prewarm.
- [x] (2026-08-06 09:05Z) Profiled the Java source timeout and added a complete-index miss fast path. Four concurrent Kafka source calls fell from an unbounded 90-second SQLite scan to 6.3 seconds total.
- [x] (2026-08-06 09:34Z) Committed the complete-index owner recovery fix as `1c2e90b9` with a regression test.
- [x] (2026-08-06 09:35Z) Completed a new sequential host-only DW10 prewarm for the exact 14-task shovel-ready set. No evaluation container performs prewarm.
- [x] (2026-08-06 17:15Z) Reprofiled Firefox with the corrected symbol arm. A 401,804-file tree exposed a serial per-language SQLite name scan. Bifrost now scans all requested languages in one active-set query. The name scans fell to 8.1-15.9 seconds in the single-task gate; the complete symbol call took 102.6 seconds.
- [x] (2026-08-06 17:15Z) Stopped the Firefox gate after a separate `get_summaries` call over `js/src` took 127.0 seconds. The tool description now warns against repository-root and broad-tree targets in large repositories.
- [x] (2026-08-06 11:25Z) Completed a corrected one-task symbol smoke with the external DW10 cache. The new CodeScale symbol arm exposed only symbol MCP tools plus artifact writing and planning; it made no usage-graph or generic workspace calls.
- [x] (2026-08-07 02:19Z) Ran all 14 shovel-ready tasks with symbol tools on runtime-r25. The r11 batch lost its driver to a session-disconnect SIGHUP after 5 tasks; the 9 missing tasks completed in `symbols-r12-final` with a setsid-detached driver. Validity gate passed: 0 MCP-start errors, 14/14 server-ready, 14/14 with a successful Bifrost call.
- [x] (2026-08-07) Scored both arms. On the 10 comparable tasks: bare mean 0.5877 across all 14 / 0.6019 comparable vs symbols 0.6021, 0 solves in both arms, file F1 identical on all 10. 4 symbols tasks unscored (2 Firefox timeouts caused by 1,200 s get_symbol_sources budget exhaustion, 2 invalid outputs). Latency evidence recorded on #1688 and new #1748. Checkpoint: `.agents/docs/codescale-grep-hard-checkpoint-2026-08-07.md`.
- [x] (2026-08-09 11:07Z) Built runtime r26 from `bifrost-nlp-ft` at `74ff5cbd`, created 6 per-repository analyzer caches (11 GB at schema v18, against 96 GB for the superseded merged v15 database), prewarmed all 14 workspaces analyzer-only on the host, and passed a one-task smoke. Provenance: `PHASE1-r26-record.md` in the campaign directory.
- [x] (2026-08-09 11:40Z) Ran all 14 tasks with symbol tools on runtime r26 in `symbols-r26-final`. Validity gate passed: 0 MCP-start errors, 14/14 server-ready, 14/14 with a successful Bifrost call, 14/14 archives. 12 tasks scored; 2 failed the answer contract.
- [x] (2026-08-09) Produced the three-arm paired report. On the 12 comparable tasks: bare 0.5872 vs r26 symbols 0.5768 mean composite, 0 solves in both. On the 10 three-arm tasks: bare 0.6019, r25 0.6021, r26 0.5940. Latency at eval scale fell hard: Bifrost calls over 5 s went from 148/381 to 105/375, median call 3.24 s to 0.96 s, total tool time 10,431 s to 3,382 s, worst call 1,200.3 s to 330.3 s. Quantified the exact-match symbol-scoring artifact and found it symmetric between arms. Report: `paired14-r26-vs-bare-v1.json` and `.md`. Checkpoint: `.agents/docs/codescale-grep-hard-checkpoint-2026-08-09.md`.
- [ ] Owner decision: version the scorer to `canonical_grep_hard_v2` with tail-normalized symbol matching and rescore all arms, or record the artifact and treat every published composite as a spelling-sensitive lower bound.
- [ ] Run the same tasks with symbol and NLP tools.
- [ ] Add synthetic semantic step zero if natural semantic use is too low.
- [ ] Produce a paired report and complete the requirement audit.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: The prior report called 15 bare-arm tasks successful, but no task scored 1.0.
  Evidence: The bare score distribution has 11 zeros, three scores of at least 0.5, and a maximum of 0.8889.
- Observation: The prior Bifrost comparison did not expose Bifrost tools.
  Evidence: Every Bifrost-arm stderr contains `Unknown argument: {bifrost_workspace_args}` and then disables the MCP server.
- Observation: The test suite required the broken literal placeholder.
  Evidence: `cimeval/test_manifest.py` asserts that the generated setup contains `{bifrost_workspace_args}` instead of starting and calling Bifrost.
- Observation: The CodeScaleBench checkout has only the `public` branch, and `grep_hard/` is untracked.
  Evidence: `git branch -a` lists only `public` and `origin/public`; `git status` reports `?? grep_hard/`.
- Observation: The selection and live verifier use different oracle files.
  Evidence: The selection records cite `ground_truth.json`, while `eval.sh` scores `task_spec.json`; 48 of 67 canonical file counts differ.
- Observation: Two candidates are not localization tasks.
  Evidence: `django-rate-limit-design-001` requires code changes, and `elasticsearch-shard-alloc-design-001` requires a new design.
- Observation: Six architecture tasks require `answer.json` in their instructions but do not declare artifact verification.
  Evidence: Their task configuration omits `verification_modes = ["artifact"]`, so Brokkbench collects the wrong output path.
- Observation: One candidate requests a repository that its task does not provide.
  Evidence: `ccx-dep-trace-116` requires `kubernetes/apimachinery`, but its Dockerfile provides Kubernetes, client-go, api, and etcd only.
- Observation: The corrected old bare outputs do not show 15 solves.
  Evidence: One of 11 scorable outputs reaches the documented 0.8 threshold. Five outputs used the wrong contract, and three candidates are invalid.
- Observation: The complete source audit leaves 64 runnable localization candidates.
  Evidence: All canonical files exist at their exact revisions. The audit excludes two non-localization tasks and `ccx-dep-trace-116`, whose required repository is absent.
- Observation: The corrected baseline is hard for Luna with grep and workspace tools.
  Evidence: Luna passed 2 of 64 tasks. The 58 scorable outputs had a 0.4132 mean and a 0.4676 median composite score. Six tasks produced no valid `answer.json`.
- Observation: The symbol smoke test started Bifrost in seconds and improved the selected task.
  Evidence: `ccx-dep-trace-273` improved from 0.7727 to 0.8081. Luna completed one `get_summaries` call and one `search_symbols` call.
- Observation: The first selected set did not satisfy the cache-ready requirement.
  Evidence: OpenJDK had no readiness record. Its first analyzer call failed because libgit2 could not resolve a moved worktree back-pointer. After that fix, cold setup exceeded 120 seconds.
- Observation: The old readiness records name the unversioned schema-14 database, not the active schema-15 database.
  Evidence: Grafana took about 154 seconds to fill missing analyzer rows in schema 15. Its next analyzer build took 1.23 seconds.
- Observation: Semantic membership order caused most of the corrected prewarm delay.
  Evidence: Django exceeded five minutes before ordered lookup. It completed in 10.8 seconds after `(blob_oid, rel_path)` sorting. Semantic membership took 3.2 milliseconds.
- Observation: The semantic profiler did not prewarm the persistent analyzer cache.
  Evidence: Each short-lived container wrote about 1.4 GB to a temporary analyzer database and deleted it. The profiler now uses `build_persisted`.
- Observation: Active semantic setup repeated random reads from the 28 GB shared database.
  Evidence: The temporary membership table used path order, while the persistent chunk key uses `(blob_oid, rel_path)`. The active table now uses the same key and reads each active chunk once.
- Observation: Canonical task containers gave Bifrost a path alias that Git did not use.
  Evidence: Django had 2,887 Python files, but Bifrost reported zero analyzed files at `/opt/work/analysis`. The canonical self-bind reports 2,997 analyzed files and reaches semantic readiness in 11.5 seconds.
- Observation: Ordinary clones did not have a full source self-bind at their canonical path.
  Evidence: Kafka exposed only `.git` there. The harness now self-binds every full prepared source tree. All 11 selected tasks completed prewarm.
- Observation: Warm analyzer construction is no longer the symbol-arm startup problem.
  Evidence: A direct Kafka profile built the complete analyzer in 0.83 seconds. Built-in semantic-pack activation did not finish within 20 seconds.
- Observation: Generator-rule overlay creation traverses every structural file once for each rule and computes an enclosing code unit before it tests the rule trigger.
  Evidence: A 20-second CPU profile spent most samples in path hashing, live-source resolution, file-state hydration, and range lookup below `generated_overlay_facts`. The active built-in pack contained only six records.
- Observation: The existing CodeScale prewarm did not activate shipped semantic models.
  Evidence: It built the persisted analyzer and semantic vector index directly. The first symbol request had to create Scala structural snapshots for the shipped case-class model.
- Observation: Parallel, grouped activation meets the warm interactive limit after structural snapshots exist.
  Evidence: On Kafka with six Rayon threads, the analyzer took 0.75 seconds, semantic-pack activation took 2.15 seconds, and `search_symbols` took 0.44 seconds. Total first-call latency was 3.55 seconds.
- Observation: A near-canonical Go receiver selector entered a full-table substring scan.
  Evidence: `get_symbol_sources` took 92.0 seconds for one call. Timing showed `suffix_resolution.pattern_stage`, and a CPU profile stayed inside SQLite. The persisted row had short name `Replica.handleRaftReady` and indexed identifier `handleRaftReady`.
- Observation: The indexed terminal lookup removes the pathological fallback.
  Evidence: The exact three-symbol CockroachDB reproduction fell from more than 90 seconds to 4.55 seconds, including 0.96 seconds of process startup.
- Observation: A concurrent Java source timeout was caused by unresolved qualified names, not Java parsing or SQLite writer contention.
  Evidence: Four concurrent requests entered `suffix_resolution.pattern_stage`; two literal SQLite scans ran for 53.4 and 58.7 seconds while the isolated exact request completed in 115 ms. The complete identifier index now makes these misses conclusive. The same four-request profile completed in 6.3 seconds with no `sql_search_definitions` timing.
- Observation: The old corrected baseline still called contract-breaking answers scorable.
  Evidence: Only 37 of 64 outputs are valid grep failures. Two are solves, six are missing, and nineteen have answer-contract errors.
- Observation: The stored baseline result records used the old contract scorer.
  Evidence: The rescore of their archived `task-output` files reports 39 scorable tasks and 25 invalid outputs: six missing artifacts and nineteen contract or repository-shape errors.
- Observation: The reported 15 of 20 result was a completion count, not a solve count.
  Evidence: The corrected Luna maximum baseline has only two solves across all 64 tasks. Every task called `grep_search`.
- Observation: The `grep_hard` source list came from manual task and oracle review.
  Evidence: Its `selection_basis` fields cite behavioral instructions and dispersed oracles. They do not cite a measured grep baseline.
- Observation: OpenJDK is not shovel-ready with the current analyzer cache.
  Evidence: Its prewarm wrote about 40 GB, then spent more than 35 minutes on one CPU core in tree-sitter. The largest Java files are generated-style tables and field fixtures. The run stopped before agent execution.
- Observation: LLVM has the same unbounded parse-tail class.
  Evidence: Its prewarm also entered a low-parallelism tree-sitter tail after ordinary files finished. The run stopped before agent execution.
- Observation: A changed profiler could complete prewarm and then fail while writing readiness state.
  Evidence: The immutable readiness path omitted the profiler hash. Runtime r10 tried to replace the old Kubernetes record after 90 seconds of valid work.
- Observation: The fix arc plus per-repository caches removed most Bifrost latency at evaluation scale, but the over-5 s headline understates the win.
  Evidence: On an almost identical call mix, 375 calls against 381, total Bifrost tool time fell from 10,431 s to 3,382 s and wall-clock occupancy fell from 6,794 s to 1,572 s. The median call fell from 3.24 s to 0.96 s and the worst from 1,200.3 s to 330.3 s. The over-5 s share fell only from 38.9 percent to 28.0 percent because agents batch more calls per turn in r26.
- Observation: Bifrost calls are heavily concurrent, so per-call durations are not additive and the over-5 s count is inflated.
  Evidence: 358 of 375 r26 calls overlap another call, with up to 6 in flight. The sum of per-call durations is 2.15 times the union of their intervals, against 1.54 in r25. On `ccx-platform-240`, three calls started together and ran 286 s, 330 s and 330 s against about 330 s of real elapsed time.
- Observation: `scan_usages_by_reference` is now the single dominant slow path.
  Evidence: 30 of 34 r26 calls exceed 5 s, its median is 17.2 s, and it is 1,410 s of the 3,382 s total from 9 percent of the calls. Its median did improve from 45.9 s.
- Observation: The exact-match symbol scorer costs every arm real recall, but it does not bias the arm comparison.
  Evidence: Tail normalization within the same `(repo, path)` adds 14 matched symbols to r26 and 15 to bare on the same 12 tasks. Micro symbol recall rises 0.4123 to 0.5351 for r26 and 0.4211 to 0.5526 for bare. Mean composite rises 0.5768 to 0.6580 and 0.5872 to 0.6799, creating two solves in each arm. The share of written symbols that carry a qualifier is 0.39 in both arms.
- Observation: A single-task smoke cannot certify the answer contract for an arm.
  Evidence: `ccx-dep-trace-273` scored 0.4545 in the r26 smoke and then failed `invalid_answer_contract` in the arm hours later on the same runtime, cache and guidance. The failure is agent output-format variance, not a harness change.
- Observation: Some lost symbol recall is file localization, not naming.
  Evidence: On `ccx-incident-110` and `ccx-onboard-103` the path-agnostic match rate is 1.0 while the tail-normalized rate stays at 0.5 and 0.2. The agent named the right symbol against the wrong file. On `ccx-platform-242` all three arms score file_f1 0.4000 with symbol_recall 0.7500.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Use composite verifier score to define task difficulty. Do not use harness completion status.
  Rationale: Completion only shows that the agent produced an artifact and the verifier ran.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Separate format failures, repository-alias failures, and localization failures during the audit.
  Rationale: Only localization failures provide evidence that grep is insufficient.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Keep the 67-task list intact until scoring cleanup and rescoring finish.
  Rationale: Removing tasks before correcting scorer defects would hide repairable benchmark errors.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Require an end-to-end Bifrost tool call before any new Bifrost batch.
  Rationale: Configuration assertions did not detect the prior server-start failure.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Use curated `ground_truth.json` as the canonical localization oracle.
  Rationale: The candidate audit used that source, and it follows the task instruction better than the stale task specification.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Call a task solved only at canonical composite score 0.8 or more.
  Rationale: A single oracle hit is useful partial credit, not a complete solution.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Preserve the original 67 rows in the audit, but run only the 64 validated candidates.
  Rationale: This keeps defects visible while preventing invalid tasks from consuming model tokens.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Use the 20 highest-scoring valid baseline failures below 0.8 for paired tool tests.
  Rationale: These tasks are near enough to the solve limit to measure useful localization gains without selecting baseline passes.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Replace the incorrect 20-task set with the 11 valid baseline failures that intersect the existing prewarm campaign.
  Rationale: Paired arms must not include cold analyzer or embedding work. The active schema-15 cache will receive a fresh readiness check before either arm runs.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex
- Decision: Use the prepared source's canonical absolute path inside canonical task containers.
  Rationale: Git and Bifrost must construct ProjectFile identities from the same root. An alias can make the persisted analyzer appear empty.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Run sequential prewarm with all 60 workstation cores, then use six cores per task at concurrency 10.
  Rationale: Initial cache hydration is parallel and persistent. The paired evaluation must share the workstation without forcing each large repository onto one core.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Group active generator rules by language and traverse each structural file once.
  Rationale: The current rule-first loop reloads a large workspace for each rule. Trigger checks can reject most nodes before the code computes an enclosing symbol.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Evaluate independent structural files through the existing Rayon pool and preserve their sorted collection order.
  Rationale: Structural extraction and snapshot hydration are file-local. Each task gives Bifrost six cores, and indexed Rayon collection keeps deterministic output.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Make the NLP prewarm profiler activate shipped semantic models before it starts vector indexing.
  Rationale: A readiness record must cover all persistent state required by the first symbol call, not only analyzer rows and vectors.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Add terminal-identifier candidates to structured suffix resolution before substring search.
  Rationale: The terminal is already a parsed symbol segment and has a persistent index. The existing alias matcher remains the final authority, so the faster candidate source does not change accepted matches.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Treat a qualified miss as final when the analyzer advertises a complete symbol lookup index.
  Rationale: The index covers every persisted declaration and definition-lookup unit. A miss after terminal and short-name candidate lookup cannot match the broad suffix pattern. This removes an unbounded SQLite substring scan while preserving the fallback for in-memory or third-party analyzers.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Treat every answer-contract error as unscorable.
  Rationale: A partial score from a malformed answer cannot prove that grep did or did not solve the task.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Define the evaluation set from measured Luna maximum grep failures.
  Rationale: Manual oracle dispersion does not prove grep difficulty. The replacement set contains the 20 highest valid scores below 0.8.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Replace the OpenJDK near-miss with the next valid Kubernetes near-miss.
  Rationale: This campaign measures warm interactive tools. A repository with an unfinished 35-minute cold parse is not shovel-ready.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Give each complete-file tree-sitter parse a ten-second budget and persist a minimal file-scope state after timeout.
  Rationale: One generated blob must not block workspace readiness. The stored blob marker prevents the same cold parse on later startup.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Include the profiler digest in each immutable CodeScale readiness file name.
  Rationale: The record content already validates this digest. Its path must permit records from more than one Bifrost build.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: Run the replacement prewarm outside task containers.
  Rationale: Container-local prewarm contends with evaluation reads and can hide query latency. The host profiler shares the cache and uses Bifrost's normal multi-device sidecar scheduler.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-06 / Codex
- Decision: The next campaign builds one analyzer cache per repository, not one cache per evaluation. This decision came from the owner as an instruction during the original campaign setup, but no prior Decision Log entry records it, and the built artifact is a single 96 GiB `bifrost_cache.v15.db` holding every repository's rows.
  Rationale: The 2026-08-07 latency investigation showed the merged database makes the dominant slow query worse: the `instr()` suffix scan covers all 8.3 million C++ rows across every prewarmed repository and filters to the current workspace with a per-row active-blob `EXISTS`, so an Envoy task pays to scan and discard Firefox, Chromium, and gcc rows. A per-repository database shrinks that scan to the repository's own rows, removes cross-repository writer contention on one WAL file, and fits each task's page-cache working set inside the 8 GiB container memory limit instead of competing for one 96 GiB footprint. Per-repository is also Bifrost's native per-workspace cache model; the central shared directory was the deviation. This layout change does not replace the indexed-lookup fix for the scan itself: Firefox's own rows dominate the C++ table, so the two 1,200 s Firefox calls need the query fix regardless.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-07 / Jonathan (instruction), recorded by Fable
- Decision: Task containers keep read-write access to the analyzer cache. The Idempotence section's older "read-only task runs" language is superseded, not the engine.
  Rationale: Read-only mounts would make complete prewarm a hard precondition and would break tasks that modify files, because incremental analysis must write rows for changed or missing blobs. The 2026-08-07 investigation measured writer contention as a minor term (total concurrency overhead at most 1.3x, dominated by the query defect, not locking), so the read-write mount was not the harm it first appeared to be. The per-repository cache decision above removes most residual writer overlap structurally: concurrent tasks on different repositories write disjoint databases. Known accepted side effect: when two concurrent tasks share one repository, an earlier task's writes can warm rows for a later task, a small ordering wrinkle in comparability rather than a defect.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

The cleanup and new evaluation are in progress. The previous symbol and NLP results must not support product conclusions.

## Context and Orientation

The Bifrost worktree is `/mnt/optane/bifrost-nlp`. It stores this plan and provides the release Bifrost binary. The Brokkbench harness is `/home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench`. Its `codescalebench_agent_engine.py` discovers tasks, runs task containers, and parses verifier results. Its `cimeval/remote/run_task.sh` writes the Mjolnir and Anvil configuration inside each task container. The CodeScaleBench checkout is `/home/jonathan/Projects/CodeScaleBench`. The 67-task selection is `grep_hard/suite_final.jsonl`. Task definitions live below `benchmarks/csb/`.

A completion outcome means the agent and verifier completed normally. It is not a solve. Composite score is the weighted task score from zero through one. A format failure means the agent found useful code but its artifact did not match the required shape. A repository-alias failure means the answer used an equivalent repository name that the scorer did not recognize. A localization failure means the scorer received a valid, normalized artifact that omitted required code.

The shovel-ready subset contains tasks whose images exist and whose exact source revisions and Bifrost vectors are already available. This restriction prevents image builds or new embeddings from changing the tool comparison.

The replacement paired manifest is `.agents/docs/codescale-grep-hard-luna-max-nearmiss20.tasks`. Each task has one valid Luna maximum baseline output, at least one `grep_search` call, and a canonical score below 0.8. Its scores range from 0.5522 through 0.7727. The set uses near-misses because they provide more sensitivity to localization-tool gains than arbitrary low-score failures. It excludes OpenJDK because that repository did not meet the warm-readiness requirement.

## Plan of Work

First, build a machine-readable audit for all 67 tasks. Read each task instruction, `task.toml`, answer parser, oracle, and verifier. Record the required output path, accepted schema, repository names, and score components. Detect inconsistent answer schemas and repository aliases. Reuse existing bare outputs where possible to determine whether each zero came from formatting, aliasing, missing output, or incorrect localization.

Next, correct the dataset and scorers. Use one canonical answer contract where task families permit it. Preserve task-specific semantic fields only when their oracle requires them. Canonicalize repository names through explicit task repository mappings. Do not accept arbitrary suffix matches. Add behavior tests with equivalent valid aliases and realistic invalid near-misses. Change reports to call normal execution `COMPLETED`, not `SUCCESS`.

Then, rescore existing outputs. This step measures how much the cleanup changes results without spending model tokens. Run a fresh Bifrost-free Luna maximum baseline across all 67 tasks. Use concurrency 10 because these task containers contain large repositories. Use a 1,800-second task limit. Define the hard set from corrected composite scores and diagnostic categories. A task is eligible only when its low score comes from localization, not output or scorer failure.

After baseline selection, fix `run_task.sh`. Generate the Bifrost MCP argument array from the named workspace specifications. Do not leave a placeholder for another component to expand. Add an end-to-end test that starts Bifrost, lists its tools, and calls one symbol tool against a small repository. Unit tests must not assert command text without executing the user-visible contract.

Before the paired arms, make complete-file parsing bounded. Use tree-sitter's progress callback for cancellation and a ten-second deadline. Persist a minimal file-scope state when a blob exceeds the deadline. Do not detect generated files by path or source-text patterns. See issue #1690.

Run one selected task with symbols. Inspect stderr, the first LLM tool schema, Bifrost startup timing, and at least one tool result. If Bifrost fails or exceeds 120 seconds, stop the batch. Profile and correct the exact path. Repeat the one-task gate until it passes. Then run the complete shovel-ready hard subset with symbols.

The corrected symbol smoke exposed a separate warm-path defect. In `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/semantic_model/overlay.rs`, change `generated_overlay_facts` from a rule-first traversal to a provider-first traversal. Select all unique rules for the provider language. Load each file's structural facts once. Test rule triggers before computing the enclosing code unit. Compute that enclosing unit once for a node with one or more matching rules. Preserve rule conflict handling and emitted fact order. Reprofile Kafka with the same six-record built-in pack before the symbol arm restarts.

Run the same task set with symbols plus NLP. Count tasks and calls for `semantic_search`. Include semantic reranker requests in utility tokens, time, and cost. If natural semantic use is too sparse for comparison, add the existing CIM-style query generation and synthetic step zero only to this evaluation mode. Limit queries by necessity, not a fixed count. Deduplicate redundant queries and keep query-model turns out of Luna's history.

## Concrete Steps

In `/home/jonathan/Projects/CodeScaleBench`, inspect `grep_hard/suite_final.jsonl` and the selected task directories below `benchmarks/csb/`. Add the audit and scorer corrections in the smallest shared modules that own the behavior. Run focused task verifier tests and the repository health command.

In `/home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench`, correct the CodeScale harness and reports. Run:

    PYTHONPATH=. uv run pytest -q tests/test_codescalebench_agent_engine.py cimeval/test_manifest.py
    RUFF_CACHE_DIR=/home/jonathan/.cache/uv/ruff-brokkbench uv run ruff check bpr_agent.py bpr_agent_engine.py codescalebench_agent_engine.py cimeval/remote/run_task.sh tests/test_codescalebench_agent_engine.py

Before a batch, run one task and inspect its archive. The first Bifrost arm is accepted only when stderr has no MCP-start error and the trace contains a completed Bifrost tool call.

Use campaign directories below `/mnt/containers/code_isnt_memory/`. Keep stopped and superseded runs for diagnosis. Never mix results from different runtime metadata.

## Validation and Acceptance

The dataset audit must contain 67 rows. The runnable manifest must contain 64 validated localization tasks. Every row must identify its answer contract, repository mapping, verifier, and current defect category. All corrected scorer tests must pass.

The fresh bare run must contain 64 result records. The hard-set manifest must exclude format failures and scorer failures. It must record the corrected score used for selection.

The symbol smoke test must prove Bifrost startup and one completed symbol call. The full symbol arm must have no MCP-start error. The NLP arm must use the identical task manifest and runtime, except for NLP enablement. Its report must include symbol calls, semantic calls, main and utility tokens, request time, cost, and paired composite scores.

Warm Kafka analyzer construction plus semantic-pack activation must complete in seconds. It must not repeat one complete structural-file pass per active generator rule. A normal `search_symbols` call must complete below the five-second product regression limit when the cache and operating-system page cache are warm.

If synthetic semantic injection is required, its trace must show the synthetic results before Luna's first turn. It must not include the query model's turn in Luna's conversation history.

## Idempotence and Recovery

Dataset audits and reports write to new versioned paths. Rerunning them must replace only derived outputs. Do not delete prior model runs. A stopped evaluation restarts in a new arm directory. Task containers keep read-write cache access so incremental analysis can fill missing or changed rows; the per-repository cache layout (see the Decision Log) limits concurrent writers to tasks that share one repository.

The CodeScaleBench checkout contains an untracked `grep_hard/` directory. Do not commit or push it until the audit proves the intended files and the correct repository branch is available.

## Artifacts and Notes

The invalid prior campaign is `/mnt/containers/code_isnt_memory/codescale-three-arm-luna-max-20-20260805`. Its data remains useful for bare-output rescoring and harness-failure diagnosis. Its Bifrost arms are not product evidence.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

The dataset audit will use the CodeScaleBench task loaders and verifier modules. It must not duplicate oracle scoring logic. The Brokkbench harness will keep `bare`, `symbols`, and `symbols-nlp` modes. It will add a real Bifrost startup gate and preserve separate main and utility LLM metrics.

Revision note: Created after the invalid Bifrost run. It expands the work to the complete 67-task cleanup and staged reevaluation.

Revision note: The complete audit found three invalid candidates. The execution count is now 64, while the audit still covers all 67 rows.

Revision note: The paired set now contains 11 cache-ready baseline failures. Canonical path and semantic startup faults were fixed before either paired arm.

Revision note: The corrected symbol arm exposed rule-first semantic-pack activation. The run stopped after four tasks so Bifrost can remove repeated workspace traversal before restart.

Revision note: The grouped and parallel traversal reduced warm Kafka first-call latency to 3.55 seconds. The prewarm profiler now creates the required structural snapshots before an evaluation.

Revision note: The second symbol arm stopped after issue #1688 exposed a full `code_units` substring scan for near-canonical Go receiver selectors. Indexed terminal lookup reduced the exact reproduction to 4.55 seconds including startup.

Revision note: Runtime r9 stopped before use after a new audit found that the 11-task paired set included malformed baseline answers. The replacement set uses only valid empirical Luna maximum grep failures.

Revision note: OpenJDK and LLVM exposed unbounded tree-sitter parse tails. Issue #1690 records the profiles. Bifrost now persists a minimal marker after a ten-second complete-file parse limit.

Revision note: Brokkbench readiness record version 5 includes the profiler digest. This prevents a new Bifrost build from replacing an older immutable campaign record.

Revision note: The six completed symbol tasks used runtime r18. One task reached an analyzer-capacity timeout while Chromium was writing the shared cache. A direct warm profile returned concurrent symbol calls in 3.4-11.6 seconds. Brokkbench now gives symbol and symbols-plus-NLP requests a 1,200-second benchmark budget; commit `3e29b4d1c2d`.

Revision note: The interrupted task rerun selected `usage_graph` on the large Kubernetes workspace. The graph stayed CPU-active for more than 18 minutes and read more than 150 GB. It produced no Bifrost error before the run stopped without a result record. The host-only Chromium prewarm remains the single cache writer and has processed about 69,800 of 164,966 files.

Revision note: The first replacement smoke still exposed generic workspace tools through Brokkbench's agent allowlist, even though Bifrost used the symbol server. The CodeScale `symbols` and `symbols-nlp` arms now allow only `write_file`, `update_plan`, and the no-line-number symbol tools. The follow-up smoke completed without generic or graph calls.

Revision note: Arm 03 ran the same 14 tasks with symbol tools on runtime r26 and per-repository caches. The latency question from 2026-08-07 is answered: total Bifrost tool time fell 68 percent, wall-clock occupancy fell 77 percent, the median call fell from 3.24 s to 0.96 s, and the 1,200 s `get_symbol_sources` calls that lost two Firefox tasks are gone. Both Firefox tasks completed. The tool-value answer did not change: bare 0.5872 against r26 symbols 0.5768 on the 12 comparable tasks, 0 solves in every arm. The exact-match symbol scorer costs each arm about 0.08 composite and two near-solves, but it is symmetric, so no arm comparison depends on it. `scan_usages_by_reference` is the remaining slow path. Three arms inside 0.01 mean composite on 10 to 12 tasks cannot separate the tools; a larger manifest or repeated runs is required before any claim of gain or of no gain is supported.

Revision note: The complete symbols arm shows no localization gain over bare on the 10 comparable tasks (+0.0003 mean, identical file F1 everywhere, 0 solves in both arms). The measurement itself is clean, but 39 percent of Bifrost calls exceeded the 5 s product limit under 10-way shared-cache concurrency, and two Firefox tasks were lost to 1,200 s get_symbol_sources budget exhaustion. Latency is now the gating question for the tool comparison: the two lost tasks are the ones where symbol tools had the most room to help. Evidence on #1688 and #1748; isolated warm reruns must split contention from single-request cost before any conclusion about tool value at Firefox scale.
