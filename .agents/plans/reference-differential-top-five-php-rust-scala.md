# Complete the PHP, Rust, and Scala top-five reference differential

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept current as work proceeds. Maintain it in accordance with `.agents/PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Bifrost exposes forward symbol lookup and inverse reference lookup through the MCP `symbols` toolset and the corresponding Rust and Python APIs. These two directions should agree: when a source reference resolves forward to a workspace declaration, an inverse query for that declaration should return the original source range unless the operation is explicitly incomplete, editor-only, or semantically ambiguous. This campaign exercises that contract on the five largest available PHP, Rust, and Scala corpus clones, audits every raw disagreement, fixes every genuine product defect, and publishes clean commit-pinned evidence for each language.

The observable result is three definitive JSONL artifacts under `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential`, one for PHP, one for Rust, and one for Scala. Each contains five completed repository records from a clean pushed Bifrost head. Every raw `missing` site is either eliminated by a root-cause fix or exhaustively documented as non-actionable with source and identity evidence. Every genuine defect has an issue assigned to `jbellis` before implementation, behavior-focused regression coverage, a pushed fix on `origin/master`, and a closed issue containing final evidence. LSP shares analyzer code and remains covered by the full repository gate, but editor protocol behavior is not the acceptance focus.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-07-17) Read `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/PLANS.md`, the original N=1 campaign plan, and the completed Java/Go/Python top-five plan. Verified the worktree is clean, detached at `b0d6a31f`, and exactly matches `origin/master`.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Deterministically selected and validated all fifteen PHP/Rust/Scala clones through `run-corpus --dry-run`. Every clone is clean. Moodle, GritQL, and IntelliJ Scala have persisted caches of 685 MiB, 30 MiB, and 167 MiB; the other twelve are cold. The clone volume has 803 GiB free and Optane has 642 GiB free.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Delegated read-only prior-campaign reconciliation and high-risk production-shape research to the Oldskool subagent while the root session owns this plan, GitHub mutations, acceptance decisions, gates, commits, merges, and pushes.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Committed the initial plan as detached `4b61d137` and rebuilt the release runner from that clean head. Direct publication was not attempted a second time after the managed approval layer rejected the first `HEAD:master` push as lacking fresh explicit approval for this new campaign. Corpus work continues from the commit-pinned clean head; integration still requires approval.
- [ ] Complete, integrate, prove, and summarize the PHP top-five leg. Baseline `php-top5-4b61d137.jsonl` completed all five repositories in 8m15s with 4.0 GiB peak RSS. Its seven raw rows reconcile to one wrong-forward artifact covered by assigned #890 and six genuine inverse misses filed as assigned issues #904 and #905. Oldskool implemented both inverse roots; independent review, 49 targeted graph tests, 16 whole-workspace graph tests, formatting, all-target/all-feature Clippy, the complete feature-enabled suite, and all six dirty-tree production exact witnesses pass. PHP was checkpointed as `d053aaaa`, current `origin/master` was merged without rebase as `9617701e`, and the complete required gate passed again at that integrated head. Publication remains blocked on fresh explicit user approval after the managed approval layer rejected the initial campaign-plan push; clean pushed-head exact/corpus proof and issue closure follow the push.
- [ ] Complete, integrate, prove, and summarize the Rust top-five leg. A clean-head bounded preflight selected the planned five repositories and exposed rust-lang/rust workspace stack overflow #907; it is assigned to `jbellis`, and Oldskool's independently reviewed iterative fix plus a 1,024-level/256-KiB-stack regression pass the complete local feature gate. A fresh ephemeral production exact record, `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/rust-exact-907-rustc-dirty.jsonl`, completes workspace construction, forward resolution, and inverse lookup on the default stack in 3m03s with actionable=0. The next broad forward phase exposes an independent hard blocker already covered by closed #850, which remains assigned to David: exact `PointerCoercion` lookup at `writeback.rs:22` spends more than three minutes in `build_reference_context -> resolve_module_files` without returning, and the bounded run stalls at 31/33 files. Per the ownership rule, the campaign documented the evidence on #850 and skips implementation until its owner resolves the path.
- [ ] Complete, integrate, prove, and summarize the Scala top-five leg. Assigned #908 is checkpointed at `cd131d74`: source-free bulk hierarchy projection reduces Scala3 descendant construction from about 120.8s to 3.35s and preserves exact class/companion/source identity. The watcher-safe full feature gate passed by running the aggregate one-thread suite without its 43 selector and nine benchmark cases, then running all 52 excluded cases individually in fresh processes; the one aggregate service failure at the host's fixed watcher ceiling also passed alone. The newest complete baseline is `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/scala-top5-bafba979.jsonl` (SHA-256 `4872bc26e2942ab41881c465a76142ba223bf1898033a76728f63846dcc592bc`): all five repositories completed with zero file errors and 1,105 raw missing rows. The corrected exhaustive ledger reconciles them exactly to 296 owned inverse rows (#661 137, #662 31, #663 128), 48 owned forward-binding #664 rows, 91 Java-target #128 skips, 180 non-acceptance rows, and 490 physical source-set/platform ambiguities. Within #663, two #502 extension rows and 16 #419/#499 trait-inheritance rows are David-owned duplicates and are documented skips; 110 rows remain #663-owned. #661/#662 are implemented at detached `a53df14f`, with four corrected #662 rows requiring exact confirmation; #663 lexical-outer and fresh-instance roots are checkpointed at `9bff10d0` and `611f27a9`, followed by the remaining owned roots, #664, the final watcher-safe gate, clean pushed-head corpora, and issue closures.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Repeated both #908 production witnesses after the hierarchy and union-receiver fixes at detached `7cefdca2`, using `max_usages=10`. Scala3 `CompletionValue.insertText` is exact-consistent with zero missing in 30.9s (`scala-exact-908-inserttext-7cefdca2-dirty.jsonl`, SHA-256 `19a27b6f3e2f8a2071ccd2efe5f9aa09cd5fa13e1f30207d2bf587bbe80f32a6`), and IntelliJ `ScalaTypeParameterInfoHandler.fromResolved` is exact-consistent across its multi-call inverse result in 18.7s (`scala-exact-908-fromresolved-7cefdca2-dirty.jsonl`, SHA-256 `4b1e55178cbf518823f7c07626137fdc6e771130096a13a3b319d4bf3b405083`). These dirty-plan records are integration evidence; issue closure still waits for the clean pushed-head repetitions.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Independently reviewed and checkpointed the next Scala roots through `7cefdca2`. Stable term patterns now distinguish Kyo's `Maybe.Absent$` singleton from its same-spelled type; Akka's lexical nested `State.registry` and Scala3's inherited `IndexedStepperBase.i0` resolve through exact declaration package and structured hierarchy paths. All five production sites are exact-consistent and actionable-zero; the focused Scala suites, formatting, and diff checks pass. The latest complete five-repository research record remains `scala-top5-77dbf045-dirty.jsonl` (SHA-256 `7869b740ae41c0cc0ad36456284d55fe8ad808ec2854581c02fcdf68705010d3`) with 1,470 raw rows. Its exact 1,470-row audit plus the `Maybe.Absent` and 47-row non-field corrections yields 608 legitimate inverse defects; the corrected exact routing is #661 335, #662 137, and #663 136 after moving thirteen constructor/companion/infix rows from #663 to #662. The other 862 rows remain 91 Java-target #128 skips, 250 non-acceptance rows, 323 single wrong-forward/non-product rows, and 198 multi-target ambiguities. Final clean-head corpus regeneration and a fresh row ledger remain required after all owned roots land.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Checkpointed Scala callable-identity and type-role corrections at `f55dcc5a` and `b5b69876`. Kyo's two external-factory `Chunk` collisions now return the honest `no_applicable_scala_callable` boundary; Scala3 `FunType` and `PcConvertToNamedLambdaParameters` resolve to exact synthetic universal constructors and are inverse-consistent. Anonymous-instance mixin RHS operands and `infix_type` operators now flow through exact type visibility without leaking same-spelled companion terms or ordinary infix expressions. Full Scala usage and whole-graph suites pass 84/84 and 30/30. Production exacts for Akka `InHandler` and ScalaTest `CanEqual` are consistent with SHA-256 `da5a7ef325a178a35ccf8cccbb8f69fc832cca9355ad5ea0ba8a425fc30ccc4c` and `0041b199c53784664f282b4ded940d9da2a60521f100795632d62bc7d38aa0d4`; the four #664 exact artifacts are all actionable-zero.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Checkpointed parser-active package resolution and unique companion method-value handling through `589f8ee3`. Exact coverage ledger `scala-661-93c00ebf-corrected335-coverage.jsonl` (SHA-256 `1b78e7026d7dc40ab999eb381e506642986d68b7057d9adf7284a4c713875938`) now has all 335 corrected #661 rows covered. Corrected #662 ledger `scala-662-589f8ee3-corrected137-coverage.jsonl` (SHA-256 `d4e3b74f81d9f0edf5ffcad954ac9e69c086e2358d33d635b6ef3ca426e4533a`) has 91 covered and 46 remaining. The exact #663 partition `scala-663-b5b69876-root-partition.jsonl` (SHA-256 `471c372c61b956fb7dacc4fbcf64eb146ea8629474ebd810635eb202d700dff3`) retains 136 callable-member rows after the thirteen-row reroute to #662.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Checkpointed Kyo `Context.Call` recovery at `6d92b9fe`. Tree-sitter truncates `object Batch` after an erroneous nested generic extractor and emits the later `object internal` header plus `Call` as compilation-unit recovery siblings. The collector now uses unmatched CST `_end_ident` evidence and indentation to restore exact `kyo.Batch$.internal$.Call` ownership, while a clean indented-root control prevents invented nesting; no source-text mini-parser is used. The Scala epoch salt invalidates stale blobs that persisted `kyo.Call`. Analyzer 23/23, direct Scala usage 87/87, whole graph 33/33, internal graph 5/5, public MCP, formatting, and diff checks pass. Production artifact `scala-exact-664-context-call-589f8ee3-parser-dirty.jsonl` is exact-consistent/actionable-zero in 5.1s with SHA-256 `261613bf11be10e0857e3d02de6e8b82d26e1723ec0e231024f7371a9dff23aa`.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Reverified open and closed GitHub history, reopened #661-#664, assigned every renewed issue to `jbellis`, posted the exhaustive corpus evidence, and filed duplicate-searched union receiver issue #913 assigned to `jbellis`. David-owned #128 remains the documented skip for the 47 Java-target annotation rows. The 352 invalid-fixture/platform/source-set ambiguities in the newer wrong-forward ledger remain non-product rows rather than fabricated analyzer defects.
- [x] (2026-07-17) Completed the corrected 137-row #662 implementation ledger through detached `220705e5`. Checkpoint `29b2633f` adds exact companion extractor projection, forward-aligned bare application precedence, zero-arity anonymous construction, synthetic constructor lowering, and receiver-typed infix dispatch; clean production probes then exposed nested-owner gaps fixed by `220705e5`, which resolves callable type paths through structural declaration owners and does not mistake a class's synthetic constructor for a shadowing method. Direct Scala usage 88/88, whole graph 34/34, internal graph 5/5, public MCP 1/1, formatting, diff checks, and all-target/all-feature Clippy pass. Clean exact representatives are consistent for extractor, zero-arity construction, lexical and visible universal constructors, infix dispatch, nested synthetic construction, and nested companion-to-class projection. The latter two clean `220705e5` artifacts have SHA-256 `258125c9a8eb67857f47fb11a0acd1cb072a15c4406c0f1acf3d859c306a03fc` and `ad5064f9808810cf87a75328b31289abc188137d828259b0d686667987590a83`. Two historical #662 rows no longer preserve their audited forward identities at this head: ScalaTest `PathMessageRecordingNotifier(...)` now returns structured `no_applicable_scala_callable`, and Kyo `Maybe(c)` resolves to field `kyo.Maybe`; the fresh corpus must reclassify them rather than count them as inverse proof. All five generated Scala caches were moved recoverably to `cache-backup-29b2633f` before the clean exacts.
- [x] (2026-07-18) Completed and corrected the authoritative `bafba979` Scala baseline audit. The immutable original `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/scala-top5-bafba979-oldskool-audit.jsonl` (SHA-256 `09496157692d2344f902c5cafa21a37d30b149525e5fe8e7b5074785e3236798`) contains exactly one row for every one of the 1,105 raw misses. Root review found six ownership mistakes: one Java target belongs to David-owned #128; one synthetic constructor and three receiver-bound infix calls belong to #662; and Scala3 `MainProxies.TypeTree` is a #664 wrong-forward because the active wildcard is `untpd.*`, not the out-of-scope `tpd.*` selected forward. The v2 corrected routing authority is `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/scala-top5-bafba979-corrected-v2-audit.jsonl` (SHA-256 `7f1a7bc9e330c6221393631fa3e86a248266382cc926e0095ee4ca4e63d2696c`), with #661 137, #662 31, #663 128, #664 48, Java #128 91, non-acceptance 180, and physical source-set/platform ambiguity 490. All 1,105 audit keys are preserved, no semantic row is left unrouted, and #913 did not occur in this sample.
- [x] (2026-07-18) Completed delegated and independent #663 ownership review. Of 128 semantically routed rows, two extension-method rows are exact duplicates of closed David-owned #502 and 16 trait/default-inheritance rows are exact duplicates of closed David-owned #419/#499; the campaign documented them on #663 and skips implementation. The 110 owned rows split into lexical-outer 51, innermost direct 23, qualified typed/direct 20, qualified stable-object 10, class-inherited three, fresh-instance two, and wildcard/export one. Checkpoints `9bff10d0` and `611f27a9` fix the lexical-outer and fresh-instance roots; five production exacts are actionable-zero, complete direct Scala tests pass 95/95, whole graph 39/39, and all-target/all-feature Clippy passes.
- [x] (2026-07-18) Checkpointed the renewed #661/#662 root fix at detached `a53df14f`. Ordered package imports and aliases, lexical nested roots, stable type members, inherited fields, and exact physical CodeUnit propagation now share structured resolution with construction/application/extractor roles for traits, case classes, nested duplicate-source constructors, and companion/object callables while ambiguous type identity remains fail-closed. Eight production exact witnesses are actionable-zero: ScalaTest typed field 4.1s; generic anonymous trait 13.7s; Akka duplicate-source nested constructor 6.2s; Scala3 companion apply 69.0s; Kyo object apply 8.3s; IntelliJ simple extractor 21.8s; Akka qualified extractor 7.2s; and ScalaTest case-class construction 3.5s. Focused validation passes ordered imports 13/13, hierarchy 17/17, whole graph 37/37, direct usage 93/93, internal graph 5/5, public MCP 1/1, fuzzy lookup 36/36, formatting, diff checks, and all-target/all-feature Clippy. The earlier #908 watcher-safe full gate remains valid integration evidence; the same coverage-preserving process partition must be repeated after all Scala roots land.
- [ ] Reconcile all final artifacts, issue states, local gates, and `origin/master`; leave the detached worktree clean.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: The metadata-selected Scala top five excludes three larger repositories because their expected clones are absent.
  Evidence: dry-run reported missing clones for `JohnSnowLabs__spark-nlp`, `apache__spark`, and `joernio__joern`, then selected the next five valid clones. Selection remains deterministic and must not be hand-edited.

- Observation: Most of this expansion is genuinely cold despite the completed N=1 campaign.
  Evidence: only one selected clone per language currently contains `.brokk`; twelve repositories require initial persisted analyzer construction. The available disk headroom is ample, but cache growth and free space must still be checked after each language.

- Observation: Prior N=1 work is a source of exact preflight leads, not proof about the current five-repository result.
  Evidence: the earlier campaign fixed PHP #671-#674, Rust #643-#660, and Scala #651/#661-#664 on older Bifrost heads. Current code and different sampled repositories can expose new shapes, so every retained raw row still requires current source/identity review.

- Observation: The PHP top-five baseline is already actionable-zero in three repositories and has only seven raw rows overall.
  Evidence: Moodle, Magento, and EduSoho reported zero `missing`; Psalm reported five and Symfony two. All five JSONL records are `status=completed`, name clean Bifrost head `4b61d137`, and match the selected repository heads.

- Observation: One Psalm raw row is a wrong forward identity, not an inverse omission.
  Evidence: `ArithmeticOpAnalyzer.php:754` is inside an outer `TLiteralString` refinement and a mutually exclusive nested `elseif`, but linear forward binding replay imports the preceding branch's `TLiteralInt` assignment and reports `TLiteralInt.value`. The open PHP CFG/branch-modeling issue #890 is assigned to David, so the campaign records and skips it under the ownership rule.

- Observation: The six legitimate PHP inverse misses form two structured roots.
  Evidence: four `$x = $x->method()` sites mutate or shadow `$x` before visiting the RHS; two variables assigned from `self::method()` lose the declared return type because targeted scoped-call inference sends `self` through ordinary namespace type resolution. Exact baseline reproductions were preserved for a representative of each family.

- Observation: PHP assignment extraction must observe evaluation order, and static scope words are owner-relative rather than namespace-relative types.
  Evidence: the accepted implementation records assignment RHS references before applying the new binding in both targeted and whole-workspace graph traversals. A shared structured helper maps `self`/`static` to the enclosing declaration owner and `parent` to its declared direct class parent. The four #904 and two #905 production exact reruns all changed from one actionable miss to zero.

- Observation: The host's fixed `fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024` ceiling can make a highly parallel full suite fail before a temporary workspace watcher starts even when the test behavior is correct.
  Evidence: the sole aggregate failure passed immediately in an isolated one-thread process. The complete suite then passed with `--test-threads=1` while excluding the 43 `searchtools_definition_selectors` cases, and all 43 excluded cases passed individually in fresh processes. Managed approval rejected a temporary host-wide sysctl increase, so the coverage-preserving process partition is the recorded local gate.

- Observation: rust-lang/rust contains a source tree deep enough to overflow recursive whole-AST identifier collection during workspace construction.
  Evidence: both isolated `run-repo` and top-four `run-corpus` preflights abort on default Rayon worker stacks. GDB shows more than 120 repeated `collect_rust_type_identifiers` frames entered from `parse_rust_file`. Assigned #907 replaces the recursion with an explicit LIFO node stack; its 1,024-level valid Rust type regression completes on a 256 KiB thread, and fresh ephemeral production exact proof `rust-exact-907-rustc-dirty.jsonl` completes workspace construction, forward resolution, and inverse lookup on the default stack in 3m03s with actionable=0.

- Observation: rust-lang/rust forward sampling is independently blocked by the still-unresolved performance root described in #850.
  Evidence: the exact `PointerCoercion` import at `compiler/rustc_hir_typeck/src/writeback.rs:22` reaches forward lookup after five seconds but does not return after more than three minutes. Timed GDB interruption finds `resolve_rust -> build_reference_context -> forward_exported_targets_from_files -> resolve_module_files`, sorting the complete analyzed file set. The bounded run also stalls on `compiler/rustc_trait_selection/src/traits/util.rs` and completes only 31 of 33 forward files. #850 remains assigned to David, so this campaign reported the evidence and did not implement the root.

- Observation: Scala inverse member queries paid complete-workspace hierarchy cost once per declaration because descendant construction called a fresh full `NameResolver` for every candidate.
  Evidence: the exact Scala3 `CompletionValue.insertText` probe spent about 120.8s in the old descendant build. With #908's source-free bulk projection, Scala3 and IntelliJ `ScalaTypeParameterInfoHandler.fromResolved` descendant builds take about 3.35s and 3.17s; complete exact runs finish in about 22.6s and 23.9s. Artifacts are `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/scala-exact-908-inserttext-f34a8799-dirty.jsonl` and `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/scala-exact-908-fromresolved-f34a8799-dirty.jsonl`. The IntelliJ record used `max_usages=1` and is intentionally inconclusive because two calls exist, so it must be repeated with at least ten usages.

- Observation: the first optimized hierarchy resolver omitted companion-object bindings even though qualified supertype paths can begin at an object.
  Evidence: independent review reduced `class Foo; object Foo { trait Base }; class Child extends Foo.Base`. The accepted correction seeds exact `$` object CodeUnits with the same same-file/explicit/wildcard priorities as ordinary types. The regression proves `companion.Foo$.Base` ancestor/descendant identity, zero point hydration, and exactly one bulk projection for each of five files.

- Observation: the host watcher ceiling requires a coverage-preserving process-partitioned full gate for the #908 tree.
  Evidence: the aggregate one-thread `nlp,python` suite ran with all 43 `searchtools_definition_selectors` cases and all nine `bifrost_benchmark_run` cases excluded. Every earlier binary was green before one `searchtools_service` case hit `fs.inotify.max_user_instances=1024`; that exact case passed in a fresh process, every later integration binary passed separately, all 43 selector cases passed individually, and all nine benchmark cases passed individually. No host sysctl was changed.

- Observation: one Scala forward file can amplify lexical receiver inference exponentially even after inverse hierarchy construction is bounded.
  Evidence: Scala3 stopped at 608/609 forward files on `Definitions.scala` and Kyo at 769/770 on `LspEngine.scala` until the one-hour process ceiling. Exact witnesses `cls.entered` and `LspBuiltInRoutes.textDocumentWillSave` reached sampling in at most 1.5s but did not produce a forward result within 20-30s. GDB showed repeated `scala_receiver_type_fqn -> scala_seed_active_path` frames and repeated definition-store queries. #910 reuses the source-ordered prefix engine during seed-time call-result inference; the same exact sites now finish in 4.6s and 6.9s, and both complete full repository records.

- Observation: a cold-cache authoritative Scala run is required because generated target-repository caches make otherwise clean-Bifrost research records non-publication evidence.
  Evidence: the five pre-existing `.brokk` directories were moved recoverably under `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/cache-backup-d7e1b037`, then `scala-top5-d7e1b037.jsonl` completed all five configured repositories from clean target heads. Every record reports `status=completed`, Bifrost `d7e1b037` with `bifrost_dirty=false`, the expected repository head with `repo_dirty=false`, and zero file errors. The artifact SHA-256 is `faa32207c78cca7a0c007c4ed1bf390b46b636dc41ba587adb4de2f2eb2ed1f3`.

- Observation: two exhaustive audits independently reconcile all 1,846 authoritative Scala raw rows.
  Evidence: the primary ledger assigns 955 genuine inverse defects to #661/#662/#663, 91 Java-target rows to closed David-owned #128, 288 rows to non-acceptance focus/import/declaration roles, 298 rows to a single wrong forward identity, and 214 rows to multi-target ambiguity. The independent audit reproduced every per-repository total and revalidated 1,425 prior exact dispositions, classified 400 new rows, and directly reviewed 21 changed-target rows. It corrected the final two disputed sites to one qualifier-focus non-acceptance and one wrong-forward test-fixture identity; no unassigned semantic bucket remains.

- Observation: the surviving generic nested-local and union receiver sites are distinct structured boundaries.
  Evidence: Kyo's `currentChunk: Chunk[A]` parameter belongs to a nested local `loop`. A two-file public `scan_usages_by_location` reduction returns the exact hit, while the same clean-head full-workspace exact query misses it, proving workspace structural facts rather than generic syntax alone trigger the boundary; reduced research continues before issue routing. Scala3's `v` parameter is a genuine union of four `CompletionValue` alternatives; forward lookup resolves `v.insertText` to their shared member, while inverse receiver proof retains only a singular owner. #913 covers the latter after open-and-closed duplicate search.

- Observation: persisted Scala declaration identity must be invalidated when structured error recovery changes ownership.
  Evidence: Kyo's source nests `Call` below `Batch.internal`, but the pre-fix blob and inverse package index exposed it as top-level `kyo.Call`, tying `Context.*` with `kyo.*`. A production-shaped reduced CST reproduces the truncation and fails before `6d92b9fe`; the Scala epoch bump forces the existing Kyo store through reanalysis, after which the unchanged `Context.Call` witness is exact-consistent.

- Observation: Scala bare application precedence depends on the callable declaration's structured owner context, not only the use-site resolver.
  Evidence: Akka's nested `ConsumerController.Settings.apply` returns bare type `Settings`; file/package resolution alone could not prove that it denotes sibling class `ConsumerController$.Settings`, so inverse class projection remained missing after the generic #662 predicate. IntelliJ's nested case-class call exposed the complementary boundary: synthetic `Value.Value` is construction, not a same-name enclosing method shadow. Owner-chain type resolution plus synthetic-aware shadowing makes both clean `220705e5` exacts consistent without weakening lexical/import collision negatives.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Process PHP, Rust, and Scala in that order, publishing a clean language boundary before starting the next.
  Rationale: This is the user-requested order. A clean pushed checkpoint prevents one language's experimental edits from changing the next language's embedded Bifrost identity or corpus resume key.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Run one language at a time with five repository jobs and twenty-four analyzer/audit workers per repository.
  Rationale: `--repo-jobs 5 --jobs 24` uses the host's 120 logical CPUs without deliberately oversubscribing across languages. It is the proven configuration from the immediately preceding top-five campaign and bounds aggregate memory better than launching all fifteen repositories together.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Use persisted caches for full top-five records and ephemeral caches for one-off exact probes when a persisted rebuild is not intentionally required.
  Rationale: full records must be resumable and should exercise the production persisted analyzer path. Exact probes should not create unrelated cache state unless they are specifically validating an epoch or warmed-cache behavior.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Treat only a valid forward identity plus a complete, non-truncated inverse query with no covering proven or unproven hit as a candidate product defect.
  Rationale: owner/receiver focus ranges, wrong forward targets, declaration roles, external boundaries, and explicit limits must not be “fixed” by teaching inverse lookup to agree with an invalid identity. The raw `missing` label is an audit lead, not the verdict.

- Decision: Delegate broad source inspection, clustering, reduced-boundary research, and substantial implementation to Oldskool while the root session retains all authority over GitHub, design acceptance, review, gates, commits, integration, and issue closure.
  Rationale: this follows the user's requested division of labor and preserves an independent review boundary around delegated work.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Do not wait for GitHub CI after a language push.
  Rationale: the user explicitly made the complete local feature-enabled test suite the blocking gate and will report later CI regressions separately.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Treat the Psalm `ArithmeticOpAnalyzer.php:754` row as a wrong-forward artifact covered by #890 and do not implement it in this campaign.
  Rationale: the semantic receiver is `TLiteralString`; making inverse lookup agree with the reported `TLiteralInt.value` would cement a false identity. The required branch-sensitive control-flow work is already assigned to another owner, and the campaign rule requires skipping such work.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Track the six genuine PHP inverse misses in #904 and #905, both assigned to `jbellis` before implementation.
  Rationale: repository-wide open/closed issue searches found no duplicate for either concrete behavior. Keeping RHS evaluation order separate from scoped static-return inference gives each root a precise acceptance boundary and production witnesses.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Accept Oldskool's PHP fix after independent structural review and preserve the shared static-scope resolver in the PHP syntax layer.
  Rationale: applying assignments after traversing their RHS follows PHP evaluation order in targeted and whole-workspace extraction, while resolving `self`, `static`, and `parent` from declaration structure avoids a second ad hoc namespace/type interpretation. Behavior tests cover reassignment, positive static factories, and the negative parent-owner boundary.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Satisfy the full local gate by process partition instead of changing the host-wide inotify limit.
  Rationale: one-thread execution removes concurrent watcher pressure, and individually running all 43 excluded selector cases preserves the exact test surface. The approval layer rejected the global sysctl mutation, so no host configuration was changed.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Track the rust-lang/rust declaration-collection overflow separately as assigned #907, but treat the subsequent module-routing stall as an owned skip under #850.
  Rationale: GDB proves two distinct stacks and phases. #907 is an unbounded recursive AST walk with no current duplicate and is assigned to `jbellis`; #850 explicitly names `build_reference_context`, `resolve_module_files`, and repeated whole-workspace validation and remains assigned to another owner. The campaign must not relabel or work around that ownership boundary.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Accept #908 only with companion-object hierarchy parity in the source-free bulk resolver.
  Rationale: parser-recorded structured lookup paths may resolve through either an ordinary class or a companion object. Populating both name namespaces from the global index preserves the existing resolver contract without recreating per-declaration full resolvers or point hydration. The independent review correction and exact nested-parent regression prevent the optimization from dropping valid Scala ancestry.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-17 / Codex

- Decision: Fix #910 by threading the already-seeded lexical prefix through seed-time receiver inference, not by adding a depth cap or source-text shortcut.
  Rationale: active-path seeding is already monotonic in source order. Re-entering `scala_bindings_before` while inferring each previous factory result expands the same prefix recursively; consuming the current `LocalInferenceEngine` is both the semantic environment visible at that point and the root-cause performance fix. Identifier queries build the prefix once and share it with companion eligibility, while literal and constructed receivers retain their old no-prefix fast path.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

The campaign started from clean `origin/master` at `b0d6a31f`; the initial plan is committed locally at `4b61d137`. The #904/#905 implementation was checkpointed as `d053aaaa`, then current `origin/master` and its unrelated C++ hierarchy work were merged without rebase as clean detached head `9617701e`. The PHP baseline is complete and exhaustively reconciled. Candidate artifacts `php-exact-904-cast-4b61d137-dirty.jsonl`, `php-exact-904-reconciler-4b61d137-dirty.jsonl`, `php-exact-904-symfony-descriptor-4b61d137-dirty.jsonl`, `php-exact-904-symfony-dump-4b61d137-dirty.jsonl`, `php-exact-905-function-call-4b61d137-dirty.jsonl`, and `php-exact-905-type-hint-4b61d137-dirty.jsonl` are actionable-zero. At `9617701e`, formatting, diff checks, all-target/all-feature Clippy, the complete one-thread feature-enabled suite, and every separately isolated selector test pass. Publication approval, clean pushed-head proof, issue closure, and the final PHP summary remain outstanding. Rust #907 is fixed, fully gated, and production-exact proven locally, while the separately assigned #850 root prevents an authoritative five-repository Rust run. Scala hierarchy issue #908 is fixed at `cd131d74`, and forward receiver-amplification issue #910 is fixed at `a94c31a7`; focused tests, formatting, diff checks, and all-target/all-feature Clippy pass. The clean-Bifrost research run now completes Kyo and Scala3, and exact controls confirm surviving companion-apply, typed-receiver, inherited-call, and union-receiver semantic misses. Exhaustive audit and owned semantic fixes precede the final persisted proof.

## Context and Orientation

Work from `/mnt/optane/tmp/bifrost-java-n10`. The worktree is detached by design. Repository rules forbid creating or switching branches, rebasing, or opening pull requests. Commits land on detached HEAD; before each push fetch current `origin/master` and merge it with `git merge --no-edit origin/master`, never rebase. Publish with `git push origin HEAD:master`. Stage only campaign files.

The differential engine lives in `src/reference_differential/mod.rs`; the command-line driver is `src/bin/bifrost_reference_differential.rs`. The driver reads corpus metadata below `/home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench/sft-tools-commits`, validates clones below `/home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench/clones` (a symlink to `/mnt/T9/repo-clones`), ranks valid clones by recorded `code_loc`, and appends one JSON object per completed repository. A record includes the Bifrost source head and dirtiness, target repository head and dirtiness, configuration fingerprint, sampled sites, forward results, inverse classifications, limits, errors, and timings.

`src/analyzer/usages/get_definition/` implements forward source-location resolution. `src/analyzer/usages/finder.rs` and the language graph modules under `src/analyzer/usages/` implement inverse usage resolution. Public symbols behavior is exercised through `SearchToolsService`, location/reference APIs, and the Python bindings where relevant. A `CodeUnit` is the stable declaration identity used to group a forward target; a `UsageHit` is an inverse result with path, byte range, kind, and proof strength. `consistent` means a proven inverse hit covers the sampled site. `unproven` means a covering best-effort hit exists without exact semantic proof. `inconclusive` covers missing/ambiguous/external forward identity, explicit limits, errors, and incompatible evidence. Only a complete inverse query with no covering proven or unproven hit is `missing`.

The deterministic selected repositories are:

The prior N=1 plan `.agents/plans/reference-differential-corpus.md` records historical root causes and exact shapes. Use it only to choose preflight witnesses and recognize known non-defect categories. Do not transfer residual ledgers across a changed Bifrost head or repository sample without exact site-key, target, classification, and diagnostic equality.

## Plan of Work

First publish this plan as a clean checkpoint and rebuild the release runner so its embedded Git metadata matches the pushed head. For each language, run the deterministic five-repository corpus with five outer jobs, twenty-four inner jobs, persisted caches, a maximum of 1,000 files, 10,000 sites, 50,000 structured candidates per file, 4 MiB source files, 1,000 inverse target groups, 1,000 candidate files per inverse query, and 100,000 usage hits. Preserve stderr and `/usr/bin/time -v` output in an adjacent log, enable shell `pipefail`, and verify both exit status and exactly five completed JSONL records.

Exhaustively inspect every raw missing row. Cluster by exact forward target, source AST role, focus token, diagnostics, and inverse outcome, but retain a row-level ledger whose counts reconcile exactly to each repository summary. Use direct source bytes, tree-sitter/analyzer structures, public symbols probes, and exact `run-repo --path --start-byte --end-byte` reruns. Do not infer a product issue merely from name similarity or a missing inverse range.

For each legitimate root, search open and closed GitHub issues before filing. If a duplicate is assigned to anyone other than `jbellis`, document it and skip implementation. Otherwise create or reuse an issue assigned to `jbellis` before changing production code. Add a behavior-focused reduction using `tests/common/inline_project.rs` when possible and cover the public symbols surface affected by the defect. Delegate substantial root-cause research and implementation to Oldskool; independently review all changes for structured AST use, exact identity, scope, caps, stack safety, platform-independent paths, and hot-loop allocation behavior.

After focused tests pass, run formatting, diff checks, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache cargo test --features nlp,python`. Commit only campaign files with a multiline checkpoint message. Fetch and merge current `origin/master`; if it changes code, repeat all required gates on the merge. Push detached HEAD directly to `master` without waiting for CI.

Rebuild the release runner from the clean pushed fixing head. Repeat every exact production witness and the complete top-five corpus. Exhaustively audit any remaining raw missing rows or prove exact semantic equality with the already audited integration candidate. Only then post fixing heads, exact artifacts, corpus evidence, and gates to assigned issues and close them. Update this plan and `.agents/plans/reference-differential-corpus.md`, publish the plan-only checkpoint if needed, give the user the language summary, and immediately begin the next language.

## Concrete Steps

From `/mnt/optane/tmp/bifrost-java-n10`, publish the initial checkpoint and build the runner:

    git status --short
    git add .agents/plans/reference-differential-top-five-php-rust-scala.md
    git commit
    git fetch origin master
    git merge --no-edit origin/master
    git push origin HEAD:master
    cargo build --release --bin bifrost_reference_differential

For `LANG` equal to `php`, `rust`, or `scala`, and `HEAD8` equal to the clean pushed Bifrost head, use:

    set -o pipefail
    /usr/bin/time -v target/release/bifrost_reference_differential run-corpus \
      --clones-root /home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench/clones \
      --commits-root /home/jonathan/Projects/brokkbench/sft-tools-commits \
      --language LANG \
      --repos-per-language 5 \
      --repo-jobs 5 \
      --jobs 24 \
      --cache-mode persisted \
      --max-files 1000 \
      --max-sites 10000 \
      --max-candidates-per-file 50000 \
      --max-source-bytes 4194304 \
      --max-targets 1000 \
      --max-usage-files 1000 \
      --max-usages 100000 \
      --seed 0 \
      --output /mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/LANG-top5-HEAD8.jsonl \
      2>&1 | tee /mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/LANG-top5-HEAD8.log

For an exact witness, use one file and an ephemeral cache unless the proof explicitly concerns persisted state:

    target/release/bifrost_reference_differential run-repo \
      --root /mnt/T9/repo-clones/SLUG \
      --language LANG \
      --output /mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential/LANG-exact-ISSUE-HEAD8.jsonl \
      --jobs 24 --cache-mode ephemeral --force \
      --path RELATIVE_PATH --start-byte START --end-byte END

Before every code push, run and expect zero failures:

    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    git diff --check
    cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/bifrost-uv-cache cargo test --features nlp,python

Also run the affected language definition, targeted usage, whole-workspace graph, public SearchTools, and Python-binding tests selected by the changed surface. Record exact test targets and pass counts in `Progress`.

## Validation and Acceptance

A language is complete only when its definitive artifact contains exactly five `status=completed` records from the expected repository heads, every record names the same clean pushed Bifrost head with `bifrost_dirty=false`, and all configured limits and errors are interpreted honestly. Every raw missing row must appear in an exhaustive disjoint ledger. A genuine defect requires a valid forward identity, a complete inverse query, and no covering proven or unproven hit; unless it is explicitly skipped because an existing issue is assigned to another owner, it must have an issue assigned to `jbellis`, a structured root-cause fix, behavior-focused regression coverage, a clean exact production proof, and final corpus proof before closure. An owned skip remains in the ledger with the covering issue and assignee; it is never disguised as inverse parity.

The full campaign is complete only when PHP, Rust, and Scala each satisfy that language boundary; every legitimate issue is assigned to `jbellis`, fixed on `origin/master`, and closed with evidence; all three fixing heads are ancestors of final `origin/master`; the complete local feature-enabled gate passed after every code integration; both campaign plans describe current reality; and the worktree is clean. Do not use GitHub CI as a blocking gate.

## Idempotence and Recovery

`run-corpus` is append-only and resume-safe. Its completion key includes language, target repository/head, Bifrost head, and configuration fingerprint, so repeating an interrupted command without `--force` skips already completed semantic keys. Records may arrive in completion order; line order is not meaningful. Verify record count and producer exit status because a successful `tee` alone does not prove the runner succeeded.

Do not delete or reset corpus caches. Do not modify clone worktrees. If a process is interrupted, rerun the identical command. If a Bifrost fix changes the source head, use a new output filename and rebuild the release runner. Preserve unrelated worktree edits and stop for user direction only if they overlap files required by the campaign and cannot be safely separated.

## Artifacts and Notes

The durable artifact root is `/mnt/optane/tmp/reference-differential`. Keep each JSONL beside its `.log`. Exact filenames must include language, issue/root identifier, and the Bifrost short head. This ExecPlan is the canonical PHP/Rust/Scala top-five ledger; `.agents/plans/reference-differential-corpus.md` remains the cross-language historical campaign record and should receive concise milestone/closure entries.

Initial dry-run selection transcript:

    php   moodle__moodle, magento__magento2, vimeo__psalm, edusoho__edusoho, symfony__symfony
    rust  biomejs__gritql, swc-project__swc, servo__servo, rust-lang__rust, Wilfred__difftastic
    scala JetBrains__intellij-scala, scala__scala3, getkyo__kyo, akka__akka-core, scalatest__scalatest

## Interfaces and Dependencies

Do not add a second differential engine or a second cache. Reuse `reference_differential::run_reference_differential`, `WorkspaceAnalyzer`, `UsageFinder`, language-specific forward resolvers, language-specific usage graphs, the persisted `AnalyzerStore`, `InlineTestProject`, and existing public SearchTools/Python API fixtures. New resolver vocabulary must come from tree-sitter nodes and shared structured indexes; do not use regex, string splitting, substring scans, or delimiter mini-parsers in place of analyzer structure. Preserve configured usage/file/target caps and explicit `unproven`/`inconclusive` outcomes.

Revision note (2026-07-17): Created the self-contained PHP/Rust/Scala top-five campaign plan from clean `origin/master`, recorded deterministic selection and cache/disk preflight, and established the Oldskool/root division of labor and per-language acceptance workflow.
