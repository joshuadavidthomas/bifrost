# Expose Rune IR for query-by-example

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds. This document is maintained in accordance with `.agents/PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

After this change, someone learning or debugging Bifrost structural queries can paste source code into the query REPL or invoke a VS Code command at a source selection and see the exact normalized structure that `query_code` matches. Bifrost calls that source-side representation **Rune IR**: the stable, language-neutral intermediate representation produced by each structural language adapter. The output also includes a conservative RQL starter query that parses through the real `CodeQuery` frontend. This makes query-by-example possible without exposing tree-sitter grammar node names or requiring a workspace index for the REPL path.

The observable REPL workflow is `:ir rust`, followed by multiline Rust source and `:end`; it prints a bounded S-expression tree and a copyable RQL pattern. The observable editor workflow is **Bifrost: Show Rune IR**, which asks the server to render the smallest enclosing indexed declaration from the unsaved overlay and opens the same server-rendered text in a new editor.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-07-14 12:00Z) Read issue #733, refreshed the current issue branch, inspected the existing structural facts, query frontend, REPL, LSP overlay, and VS Code extension seams, and selected the public name Rune IR.
- [x] (2026-07-14 14:05Z) Implemented and tested a bounded, deterministic Rune IR renderer and starter-RQL generator over the existing `FileFacts` arena; 5 focused library tests pass for Rust, Python, TypeScript, selection, escaping, parseable starters, errors, and all four limits.
- [x] (2026-07-14 14:25Z) Added the index-free multiline `:ir <language>` REPL workflow with explicit `:end`, actionable input errors, colon-preserving source capture, lazy-service isolation, help/completion metadata, 15 passing binary tests, and a successful real scripted Rust smoke run.
- [x] (2026-07-14 14:50Z) Added `bifrost/runeIr` with overlay-aware source reads, exclusive cursor/range params, smallest-enclosing indexed `CodeUnit` selection, primary-range Rune IR roots, UTF-16 response ranges, opaque display text, unit coverage, and a passing end-to-end Rust/TypeScript LSP test.
- [x] (2026-07-14 15:05Z) Added **Bifrost: Show Rune IR** for supported source editors, using selection-or-cursor request params and opening the server-provided display text verbatim; TypeScript and manifest tests pass as part of all 48 VS Code tests.
- [x] (2026-07-14 15:25Z) Documented Rune IR as the source-side representation matched by `CodeQuery`, documented both query-by-example surfaces, passed Astro content checks and the production build, and visually verified the rendered code-querying page in the in-app browser.
- [x] (2026-07-14 12:14Z) Reviewed the complete branch diff, repaired truncation so every bounded Rune IR result remains a balanced S-expression, passed `cargo fmt --check`, 7 focused library tests, 15 REPL tests, the overlay LSP integration test, all 48 VS Code tests, and all-target/all-feature clippy with warnings denied. The full `nlp,python` test binary remains un-linkable in this local PyO3 environment as recorded below.
- [x] (2026-07-14) Remediated guided-review findings in structural extraction and LSP: centralized the default grammar registry, preserved explicit/path-derived TSX grammar selection, rejected source above 256 KiB before parsing, removed unresolvable arena IDs from role forms, and passed 9 focused library tests plus the TSX-aware overlay LSP integration test.
- [x] (2026-07-14) Remediated guided-review findings in the REPL by sharing capture state with Reedline validation, making captured lines complete regardless of delimiters, and cancelling/resetting capture before it exceeds 256 KiB; all 17 REPL tests pass.
- [x] (2026-07-14) Remediated the duplicated VS Code runtime source-language registry by deriving both client selection and Rune IR validation from one exported list; added manifest consistency coverage and passed all 49 extension tests.
- [x] (2026-07-14) Documented explicit TSX selection and the 256 KiB pre-parse/capture bound, reran the complete post-fix validation matrix, reviewed the full merge-base diff, and closed all six guided-review findings. All compiled default-feature Rust test binaries passed; the final rustdoc phase passed in an isolated rustup target after the shared target exposed a Homebrew/rustup metadata collision. All-target/all-feature clippy, 49 extension tests, Astro checks, and the production docs build pass.
- [x] (2026-07-14) Registered `.rune` as Bifrost Rune IR, added canonical kind/role highlighting locked to the Rust registries, rendered LSP preview headings as `;` comments, and opened previews in the Rune IR language mode without making saved `.rune` files start the language server. The registry test, overlay LSP test, all 50 extension tests, Astro checks/build, formatting, and all-target/all-feature clippy pass.
- [x] (2026-07-14) Added a dedicated Rune IR page under Rune Query Language, moved the complete language-adapter mapping out of the general querying overview, documented `.rune` structure and non-executable semantics with renderer-verified offsets, and linked the related RQL, VS Code, tutorial, and overview pages. Astro checks and the 39-page production build pass; the rendered page, sidebar placement, document example, overview links, and browser console were verified in the in-app browser.
- [x] (2026-07-14) Optically aligned the shared `.rql`/`.rune` Explorer icon by translating its unchanged artwork 40 pixels right on the 512-pixel transparent canvas. Screenshot measurement and 16-pixel raster checks show this moves the optical center by one rendered pixel to match neighboring Explorer icons; a raw-pixel comparison proves translation was the only image change, and all 50 VS Code tests pass.
- [x] (2026-07-14) Closed all eight findings from the final merge-base guided review: Rune IR now shares the analyzer's canonical parser/spec registry and source-safety gate; REPL capture preserves leading blank lines without persisting captured source; terminal output escapes bidirectional controls; TSX is labeled and discoverable explicitly; Python import/assignment behavior has focused coverage; and the TextMate suites share one harness. Focused Rune IR, REPL, LSP, and all 50 VS Code tests pass, as does all-target/all-feature clippy with warnings denied.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: “Rune” is already the expanded name of RQL in the documentation and VS Code grammar.
  Evidence: `docs/src/content/docs/code-querying.md` calls RQL “Rune Query Language,” and `editors/vscode/syntaxes/bifrost-rql.tmLanguage.json` uses the same name. This makes Rune IR a coherent paired name for the source representation that Rune queries inspect, but the docs must still distinguish Rune IR from the query-side `CodeQuery` IR.
- Observation: The Bifrost code-intelligence skills are installed but their MCP tools are not exposed in this session.
  Evidence: the available tool inventory contained no `search_symbols`, `get_summaries`, `get_symbol_sources`, `scan_usages`, or filename-search endpoint, so repository exploration used bounded `rg` and direct source reads.
- Observation: The local all-feature Rust link gate cannot resolve PyO3 symbols on this macOS environment.
  Evidence: `cargo test rune_ir --features nlp,python` compiled the Rune IR code, then failed while linking `libbrokk_bifrost.dylib` with undefined `_Py*` symbols. `cargo test --lib rune_ir` avoids the unrelated optional Python bridge while still parsing Python through the always-available tree-sitter adapter and passes all 5 tests.
- Observation: `cargo clippy` and `cargo test` are selecting incompatible local Rust compiler identities while sharing `target/` artifacts, even though both report Rust 1.96.0.
  Evidence: after the focused tests passed, the first clippy attempts rejected dependency metadata with E0514. `type -a cargo-clippy` showed Homebrew's subcommand before rustup's even though `cargo` itself came from rustup. Running with `/Users/dave/.cargo/bin` first on `PATH` and a fresh target directory passed `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`; deleting the shared target directory was unnecessary.
- Observation: a truncation marker alone was not enough to preserve Rune IR's S-expression contract when a node or depth limit interrupted nested output.
  Evidence: the complete-diff review showed open node forms could remain unclosed. The renderer now reserves space for compact closing parentheses, and every bounded-dimension test verifies balanced parentheses while respecting the byte limit.
- Observation: the initial pathless `Language -> grammar` registry erased the existing file-sensitive TypeScript/TSX distinction.
  Evidence: `:ir tsx` on `function View() { return <div>{value}</div>; }` rendered only identifiers and generated an identifier starter, while `TypescriptAdapter::parser_language_for_file` deliberately selects the TSX grammar for `.tsx` files.
- Observation: the interactive Reedline validator receives input before `ReplSession`, so session-local capture state cannot make malformed source lines complete.
  Evidence: an unclosed `(` keeps Reedline's query validator in multiline mode and prevents a later `:end` line from reaching `process_rune_ir_line`; capture state must be shared with validation or interactive capture must use a raw input path.
- Observation: the sandbox PTY cannot complete Reedline's cursor-position handshake, so a direct interactive smoke cannot run in this environment.
  Evidence: launching the real REPL under the available PTY failed with `The cursor position could not be read within a normal duration`; the regression is instead exercised through the same shared atomic capture flag, `ReplValidator`, and `ReplSession` used by the interactive path.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Name the public source-side representation “Rune IR,” described on first use as “Bifrost’s normalized structural intermediate representation.” Retain `FileFacts` and `NormalizedNode` as storage implementation names unless a local API name becomes misleading.
  Rationale: Rune matches the existing Rune Query Language and Brokk’s Norse theme, is concise in commands and UI, and avoids the opaque acronym NSIR. Avoiding a fabricated expansion for RUNE keeps the terminology honest. `CodeQuery` remains the separate typed query-side IR.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-14 / Codex
- Decision: Put extraction, selection, rendering, and starter generation behind one Rust module used by both REPL and LSP.
  Rationale: The UI must not duplicate vocabulary or renderer behavior, and identical source should produce byte-for-byte identical Rune IR across surfaces.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-14 / Codex
- Decision: Render containment as nested node forms and role edges as explicit `(role-label ...)` child forms, including a span-only target form when the adapter has no normalized target node.
  Rationale: The distinction is matcher-visible, deterministic, and preserves role targets that cannot be represented as containment nodes or a single RQL pattern.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-14 / Codex
- Decision: Treat the six confirmed guided-review findings as three independently verifiable remediation milestones: structural/LSP correctness, REPL input behavior, and editor registry consistency.
  Rationale: The first two milestones change separate runtime surfaces and need focused behavioral verification; the editor cleanup is mechanical and can be validated by the extension suite. The grouping preserves checkpoint commits without mixing unrelated fixes.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-14 / Codex
- Decision: Keep role forms self-contained with canonical role, span, keyword/name, and escaped text rather than exporting `FileFacts` arena offsets.
  Rationale: Arena IDs are storage details, were not identified on rendered nodes, and could point outside a selected or truncated result. Removing them preserves the observable role edge without publishing an unstable reference protocol.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-14 / Codex
- Decision: Bound Rune IR source input at 256 KiB before parsing while continuing to parse the full bounded document for LSP parity.
  Rationale: Parsing only a declaration fragment can change adapter behavior for fields and other context-dependent constructs. A hard pre-parse bound prevents unbounded synchronous work without sacrificing equivalence to matcher-visible full-file facts inside the supported envelope.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

The issue is implemented end to end under the public name Rune IR. Callers can render bounded, balanced Rune IR and a validated starter RQL directly from source for every registered structural language without constructing a workspace analyzer; Rune IR and workspace analysis now resolve grammars and structural specs through the same canonical registry; explicit and file-derived TSX parsing preserves JSX; input passes the analyzer's source-safety gate before parsing and capture is bounded at 256 KiB; role forms no longer leak arena-local identifiers; and malformed captured source reliably reaches `:end`. REPL capture preserves exact leading-line offsets, excludes captured source from persistent history, and escapes terminal directionality controls at the display boundary. The private LSP request returns identical Rune IR from unsaved overlay content with indexed declaration selection, accurate TSX labeling, and UTF-16 ranges. VS Code registers `.rune` as Bifrost Rune IR, opens previews in that highlighted language mode, keeps canonical kind/role highlighting locked to the Rust registries, leaves saved `.rune` inspection passive rather than starting an index, and uses an optically aligned shared Explorer icon for `.rql` and `.rune`. The documentation builds cleanly and its rendered preview presents the architecture and workflows correctly. Formatting, focused Rust/LSP tests, all compiled default-feature Rust test binaries, isolated rustdoc tests, all 50 extension tests, Astro checks/build, and all-target/all-feature clippy pass. The only unavailable gate is the full `nlp,python` test link in this machine's existing PyO3 environment; its undefined Python symbols are unrelated to Rune IR.

## Context and Orientation

Structural adapters translate grammar-specific tree-sitter nodes into language-neutral facts. `src/analyzer/structural/extract.rs` performs that translation and creates a flat pre-order arena called `FileFacts`, defined in `src/analyzer/structural/facts.rs`. Each `NormalizedNode` records a canonical `NormalizedKind`, a byte range, optional derived name, containment parent, typed role targets, and the end of its contiguous descendant range. The matcher reads only these facts, so Rune IR must render this arena directly and never walk or print the raw parse tree.

Canonical kind and role spellings live in `src/analyzer/structural/kinds.rs`. RQL is the Rune Query Language S-expression frontend. It and canonical JSON both compile into the typed `CodeQuery` model under `src/analyzer/structural/query/`; `CodeQuery::from_source` is the acceptance boundary for generated starter queries.

The interactive query shell is `src/bin/bifrost/code_query_repl.rs`. It already recognizes colon commands and maintains multiline query state. The new `:ir <language>` mode must capture arbitrary source until a line containing only `:end`; it must resolve the language with `Language::from_config_label`, use the language’s real grammar and `StructuralSpec`, and avoid constructing `SearchToolsService` for extraction.

The LSP server in `src/lsp/server.rs` owns an overlay project containing unsaved document text. Existing helpers in `src/lsp/handlers/util.rs`, `broad_symbol.rs`, and `document_symbol.rs` demonstrate overlay reads, point/range conversion, and indexed `CodeUnit` hierarchy selection. The private `bifrost/runeIr` request will accept a text document and either cursor position or selection range. It returns the selected code-unit label, UTF-16 range, rendered Rune IR, starter RQL, and one already-formatted display document. If no exact normalized node covers the code unit, the renderer selects top-level facts wholly contained in its primary source range.

The VS Code extension in `editors/vscode/src/extension.ts` owns the `LanguageClient`. `editors/vscode/package.json` declares commands and source-editor context menus. TypeScript should send the request using the active editor’s URI and cursor or selection, then open the returned display text. It must not parse S-expressions, translate kinds, or generate RQL.

## Plan of Work

First add `src/analyzer/structural/rune_ir.rs`. Define public request-independent types for render limits, a rendered result, and an optional byte selection. Add a language registry function that returns the existing grammar and structural spec for a `Language`; it should use the same adapter implementations as workspace analysis rather than a second normalization table. Extract `FileFacts`, choose roots in source order, and iteratively render nested containment plus explicit role forms. Track node count, depth, source bytes copied, and output bytes. Escape source-derived strings as valid JSON string literals inside the S-expression, sanitize control characters, and append an explicit `(truncated "reason")` form when a cap is reached. Generate `(kind (name "exact"))` or `(kind)` from the selected/top-level root and prove it parses with `CodeQuery::from_source` before returning it.

Add unit tests beside the renderer for escaping, deterministic role/containment ordering, span-only role targets, root selection, every limit, and starter parsing. Add adapter-backed tests for representative Rust, Python, and TypeScript source covering declarations, calls, positional and keyword arguments where supported, decorators, imports, assignments, and field access. Assertions should focus on canonical labels and absence of raw grammar names rather than duplicating every adapter table.

Next extend the REPL state machine. `:ir <language>` enters a dedicated source-capture state; `:end` extracts and renders immediately. Empty input, unsupported labels, and adapters without structural support return actionable errors. Source lines beginning with ordinary colon text remain source. Tests should drive the state machine without a workspace service and compare its Rune IR payload with the shared renderer.

Then add serializable LSP parameter and response structs and private request dispatch. Read the URI through the overlay, resolve its analyzer language, and use indexed `CodeUnit`s to find the smallest declaration whose primary range encloses the requested point or selection. Convert that byte range against the overlay text, render facts within it, and return precise UTF-16 positions. For a point outside any usable declaration, attempt a direct smallest-fact selection; if no fact is usable, return an actionable protocol error. Tests must open and change a document to prove unsaved content wins, cover function/method/type/field/constructor-like `CodeUnit`s across representative adapters, and compare the `nsir`/Rune IR string to direct rendering of the same source.

Finally register `bifrost.showRuneIr` in VS Code and contribute a command-palette and source-editor context entry for supported source language IDs. The handler sends `bifrost/runeIr`, passes either the non-empty selection or active position, and opens a language-neutral text document containing the server-provided display string. Add focused TypeScript tests for parameter construction, readiness/error handling, and verbatim display behavior. Update the structural querying documentation and navigation so “Rune IR” is defined before RQL/`CodeQuery` are contrasted.

## Concrete Steps

All commands run from `/Users/dave/.codex/worktrees/3ec0/bifrost`.

After the shared renderer milestone, run:

    cargo test rune_ir --features nlp,python
    cargo fmt --check

After the REPL milestone, run the focused binary tests and an interactive smoke input equivalent to:

    printf ':ir rust\nfn greet(name: &str) { println!("{name}"); }\n:end\n:quit\n' | cargo run --bin bifrost -- code-query-repl

The output must contain canonical `function` and `call` Rune IR forms and a starter query accepted by `CodeQuery::from_source`; it must not contain Rust grammar labels such as `function_item` or `call_expression`.

After the LSP and editor milestones, run:

    cargo test --test bifrost_lsp_server --features nlp,python rune_ir
    npm --prefix editors/vscode test
    npm --prefix editors/vscode run compile

At completion run:

    cargo fmt
    cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    cargo test --features nlp,python

If the full suite is too slow for an iteration, keep the focused commands green and record the full-suite result or remaining gate in `Progress` and `Outcomes & Retrospective`.

## Validation and Acceptance

`:ir rust` must accept multiline source through `:end` without indexing a workspace and print deterministic Rune IR followed by a copyable RQL starter. Unsupported language, empty source, no structural adapter, and no usable facts must each produce a specific error that tells the user what to change.

The renderer must show canonical labels from `NormalizedKind::label` and `Role::label`, preserve source-order containment, distinguish role forms from nested containment, include exact names and keyword names when present, and include span-only role targets. Tests must demonstrate output truncation for every bounded dimension and safe escaping of quotes, backslashes, newlines, terminal controls, and invalid range boundaries.

The LSP request must use unsaved overlay text, choose the smallest enclosing indexed code unit where one exists, and return UTF-16 ranges that select the same source in VS Code. Direct rendering and LSP rendering of identical selected source must be equal. The VS Code command must display the server’s text verbatim and contain no client-side normalized vocabulary table.

Documentation must present the pipeline as source to language adapter to Rune IR, and RQL to `CodeQuery`, followed by matcher evaluation. It must explicitly say Rune IR is not a raw tree-sitter tree and `CodeQuery` is not Rune IR.

## Idempotence and Recovery

Extraction and rendering are pure operations over source text and can be rerun safely. The REPL command holds captured source only until `:end` or cancellation. LSP requests do not mutate the overlay or workspace index. If a milestone fails, retain the shared renderer API and remove only the uncommitted surface integration; each completed milestone is committed separately on the current branch as required by `.agents/PLANS.md` and the repository instructions.

## Artifacts and Notes

The intended architecture is:

    source -> language adapter -> Rune IR
    RQL    -> CodeQuery
    matcher(CodeQuery, Rune IR)

The canonical public phrase is “Rune IR, Bifrost’s normalized structural intermediate representation.” “RUNE” is not an acronym.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

`src/analyzer/structural/rune_ir.rs` will expose a pure entry point shaped like:

    pub fn render_source_rune_ir(
        language: Language,
        source: &str,
        selection: Option<Range<usize>>,
        limits: RuneIrLimits,
    ) -> Result<RenderedRuneIr, RuneIrError>;

`RenderedRuneIr` contains the complete bounded S-expression string, starter RQL string, selected byte range, and truncation metadata. The exact ownership types may change to fit existing error and range conventions, but both REPL and LSP must call this one entry point.

The private LSP method is `bifrost/runeIr`. Its result contains `codeUnit`, `sourceRange`, `runeIr`, `starterRql`, and `displayText`. `runeIr` is server-rendered text; the extension treats it as opaque.

No new third-party Rust or npm dependency is expected. JSON string escaping should use existing `serde_json`; grammar and structural adapters are already dependencies of the analyzer.
