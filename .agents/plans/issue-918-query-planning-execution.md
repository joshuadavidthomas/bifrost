# Separate CodeQuery planning, execution, profiling, and shared graph materialization

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must remain current while implementation proceeds. Maintain this document in accordance with `.agents/PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

After this work, a `query_code` request will no longer use its parsed recursive expression as its execution strategy. Bifrost will lower the authored query into an explicit logical dependency graph, choose concrete physical operators, and execute scheduled alternatives through a bounded scheduler. A user will be able to inspect an explain view before execution and a profile after execution, including operator timing, cardinality, shared-cache behavior, dependency waiting, scheduling overhead, and concurrency. Independent union branches have a measurable parallel alternative, but production selection remains sequential until future evidence identifies a stable pre-execution signal for when parallelism wins.

The work also creates a safe boundary for expensive derived graph layers. Concurrent branches requesting the same graph snapshot will share one complete in-flight materialization. If profiling identifies a stable SQL-backed relation worth loading into memory, Bifrost will bulk-read only the required columns, remap persistent identities to typed dense IDs, and freeze an immutable compact adjacency snapshot. SQL-backed graph loading is a measured later optimization, not a prerequisite for the first planning refactor.

The first independently verifiable milestone is deliberately sequential. Existing JSON and Rune Query Language (RQL) inputs lower to a dense logical directed acyclic graph, physical planning selects explicit sequential set operators, the current semantics execute through that physical plan, and an internal structured profile reports `peak_concurrency = 1`. No Rayon task, future, or guessed scheduling threshold is introduced in that milestone.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-07-20 14:28Z) Confirmed the clean issue branch, fetched `origin`, verified the branch equals current `origin/master` and its upstream at `ce79d33b`, and read live issue #918.
- [x] (2026-07-20 14:28Z) Traced the parser, recursive executor, branch budgets, shared request caches, compact graph primitives, persisted snapshot path, semantic single-flight cache, and focused regression suites.
- [x] (2026-07-20 14:28Z) Inspected the reference implementation's SQL-to-memory graph techniques and separated transferable techniques from unsuitable sparse-ID, repeated-build, and quadratic paths.
- [x] (2026-07-20 14:28Z) Chose the storage-neutral sequential plan spine and the measured later graph-materialization boundary described below.
- [x] (2026-07-20 15:09Z) Milestone 1: lowered authored queries into a logical DAG, selected and executed an explicit sequential physical plan without public semantic change, added opt-in structured explain/profile observations, completed adversarial review, and passed the focused tests plus strict all-target/all-feature Clippy.
- [x] (2026-07-20 20:38Z) Milestone 2: completed opt-in operator, work, cache, termination, and request-phase instrumentation; added a versioned ignored benchmark; ran optimized reversed-order measurements plus an M1 ordinary-path differential; and deliberately deferred scheduler thresholds and storage selection.
- [x] (2026-07-21 08:06Z) Fetched `origin/master` and cleanly rebased the M1/M2 checkpoints onto `a84d6df4`; the rebased M2 checkpoint is `063b8ad9`.
- [x] (2026-07-21 09:01Z) Milestone 3: extracted a generic complete-value single-flight, proved exact layer-owned key requirements and generation cutover with a fake composite key, annotated reverse-import physical plan nodes with request metadata, measured and discarded the non-equivalent `unit_children` SQL negative control, removed the prototype, completed adversarial review, and passed focused regressions plus strict Clippy.
- [x] (2026-07-21 13:24Z) Fetched `origin/master` and cleanly rebased the M1-M3 checkpoints onto `0955e1c7`; the rebased M3 checkpoint is `d6d0837f`.
- [x] (2026-07-21 13:37Z) Milestone 4: added a bounded ready-task scheduler and independently selectable parallel union, preserved authored results/provenance and fair global budgets, hardened cancellation/panic behavior, corrected the A/B harness after adversarial review, and selected the conservative production-sequential policy because no stable cold-and-warm crossover survived.
- [x] (2026-07-21 14:12Z) Refetched the moving `origin/master` and cleanly rebased all four milestone checkpoints onto current `8f8a0ef7`; the rebased M3 checkpoint is `cf920952`.
- [x] (2026-07-21 16:02Z) Milestone 5: exposed explain/profile through every supported query surface, documented the measured production-sequential scheduling policy and rejected alternatives, completed adversarial review with no remaining P0-P3 findings, and passed final repository validation.
- [x] (2026-07-21 16:53Z) Post-M5 housekeeping: centralized physical-plan selection and capacity, execution-work snapshots, response decomposition, provenance and diagnostic presentation, MCP `query_file` exclusions, and Python execution-mode/cache decoding while preserving the public-v1/internal-v4 compatibility boundary.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Initial observation before M1: `CodeQueryPlan` was both the semantic recursive tree and the execution strategy.
  Evidence: at plan start, `src/analyzer/structural/search.rs::execute_plan` directly pattern-matched `CodeQueryPlanSource`. M1 replaced that coupling with explicit logical lowering and physical selection while preserving recursive authored-order execution semantics.

- Observation: the current request state already shares completed structural seeds and several semantic caches, so the new plan boundary must preserve those reuse and charging semantics before adding concurrency.
  Evidence: `QueryExecutionState` owns `seed_cache`, `indexed_declarations`, `reference_cache`, `call_cache`, and the lazy `DirectImportGraph`; focused tests prove complete and truncated seed reuse, roll-forward budgets, branch provenance, and root-only limits.

- Initial observation before M3: Bifrost already contained a cancellation-aware same-key single-flight implementation that published complete values only.
  Evidence: `CompleteSemanticArtifactCache` in `src/analyzer/semantic/service.rs` originally owned retained values and its leader/follower map. M3 extracted that lifecycle into `src/analyzer/complete_value_cache.rs`; the semantic cache now delegates to it, and later layer owners must reuse the generic lifecycle instead of cloning it.

- Observation: `PoolSafeMemo` deliberately permits duplicate builds in some Rayon contexts.
  Evidence: blocking a worker on work queued to the same saturated pool previously deadlocked. A query scheduler must model dependency waiting or use a build executor that cannot starve, rather than placing a naive condition variable around arbitrary Rayon work.

- Observation: existing compact graph types are useful implementation evidence but are not a drop-in query graph cache.
  Evidence: `CompactDirectedGraph<K>` needs a complete node list and edge vector, sorts the edge list twice, duplicates endpoint adjacency for both orientations, and has no generation key, cancellation, tracing, or in-flight lifecycle. `ControlFlowGraph` in `src/analyzer/semantic/ir.rs` is the stronger pattern: one canonical rich-edge table, outgoing row boundaries, and incoming edge IDs built by count, prefix sum, and scatter.

- Observation: persisted structural snapshots proved large warm materialization wins but also measurable cold and storage costs.
  Evidence: the 200-file benchmark improved warm materialization from 140.420 ms to 43.573 ms and the 400-file benchmark from 539.081 ms to 144.334 ms, while cold materialization regressed 16.8–21.1 percent and database size grew roughly 37–38 percent. This supports measuring a specific stable relation rather than persisting every graph.

- Observation: the reference repository's useful loader pattern is narrower than its product claims.
  Evidence: its good paths bulk-select graph-critical columns, remap persistent IDs to dense local IDs, preallocate adjacency, and build compressed sparse rows. Other paths rebuild on every request, allocate from `MAX(id) + 1` without a sparsity guard, or use linear endpoint lookup and edge deduplication. Bifrost should borrow the former techniques and reject the latter.

- Observation: Bifrost navigation found the relevant executor symbols, but `scan_usages_by_location` omitted known external uses of `CodeQueryPlan` and `DetailedCodeQueryResult`; a multi-target scan also stalled while individual scans were fast. `search_git_commit_messages` associated at least one hash with the next commit's message.
  Evidence: direct symbol reads and local `rg`/`git show` confirmed the missing uses and corrected the commit mapping. Treat these as separate Bifrost tooling follow-ups, not as evidence about issue #918's implementation.

- Observation: lowering one authored step suffix into individual DAG nodes exposes control-flow state that the recursive executor previously carried implicitly.
  Evidence: exact parity required `final_in_authored_suffix` on step nodes plus a private halted-pipeline result bit. Without them, cancellation could retain a wrong-domain intermediate row or a later step could run after an earlier step exhausted its budget. Cancellation polling also had to remain at authored Seed/Set entry, immediately before each Step, and at root Limit finalization so test cancellation checkpoints did not move.

- Observation: a shared DAG node and one execution of an incoming dependency edge are different identities.
  Evidence: two union branches can reference one interned Seed node while each occurrence still replays diagnostics and charges its fair branch budget. Profile observations now retain the shared node ID and a stable nested branch-slot path, so later parallel completion order cannot erase per-invocation attribution.

- Observation: useful profiles must not turn semantically distinct same-topology queries into the same explanation or distort the ordinary path being measured.
  Evidence: explain nodes now include canonical seed and step JSON, authored suffix finality, set operator, and limit count. Profiling is opt-in; ordinary detailed and public execution allocates no explain, branch path, observation vector, or `Instant` timer. Observations distinguish completed, skipped, and cancelled operators and separate operator-local clipping from the aggregated result status.

- Observation: this machine has rustup Cargo before Homebrew Cargo but Homebrew `cargo-clippy` before rustup's proxy on `PATH`.
  Evidence: plain `cargo clippy` compiled dependencies with the pinned rustup compiler and then invoked Homebrew Clippy, yielding `E0514` incompatible-compiler metadata despite the same displayed release. Direct `rustup run 1.96.0 cargo-clippy` used the pinned driver and passed the strict gate.

- Observation: cache "hit" is not decision-grade without both lifecycle and completeness.
  Evidence: request-local seed results, seed-path structural facts, inbound/outbound references, incoming/outgoing calls, and forward/reverse imports have different reuse boundaries. Seed materialization can also satisfy a root terminal-cap probe while remaining incomplete as a reusable relation. The M2 profile therefore records typed per-layer outcomes, complete/incomplete/unknown builds and hits, replayed payload counts, and exact seed-path memory, hydration, extraction, unavailable, and unknown outcomes.

- Observation: instrumenting completeness exposed an existing partial-reference replay correctness gap.
  Evidence: after a budget-exhausted reference traversal populated a request-local partial cache, a sibling branch replayed those rows but could continue into a later step as though the relation were complete. The cache now retains execution exhaustion separately from telemetry completeness, and a focused regression proves both sibling pipelines halt instead of deriving a misleading downstream value from a partial relation.

- Observation: dependency wait and scheduler overhead are real profile fields but necessarily zero in Milestone 2.
  Evidence: the physical executor still invokes dependency subtrees inline on one thread. The profile separates operator self-time, inclusive time, dependency execution, dependency wait, merge, and scheduler overhead so M3/M4 can populate the waiting and scheduling fields without changing the schema, while M2 asserts `peak_concurrency = 1` and zero wait/overhead.

- Observation: the same topology can have very different overlap ceilings and shared-dependency constraints.
  Evidence: optimized large distinct exact unions projected 49.73–49.80 percent idealized perfect-overlap headroom, while large distinct broad unions projected only 14.35–14.40 percent. Identical seeds, shared reference traversal, and shared import topology were deliberately ineligible. These are optimistic wall-time lower bounds, not measured parallel speedups.

- Observation: opt-in profile collection is cheap on these fixtures, but the ordinary M2 code path is not literally byte-for-byte cost-free versus M1.
  Evidence: paired M2 profiled/unprofiled deltas ranged from -0.77 to +1.91 percent across two optimized rounds. A separate four-round public-API comparison against the exact M1 checkpoint preserved all result digests and produced combined ordinary-path medians from -0.32 to +1.82 percent, with one non-reproduced broad-query timing outlier.

- Observation: M2 identified resolver-heavy reference and import traversals, but neither relation currently has stable resolved topology columns in the store.
  Evidence: the store persists parsed reference/import inputs and packed structural facts, while language-specific resolution still depends on live analyzer state. Structural facts are already a versioned dense arena with CSR role rows, so another SQL graph would duplicate its warm representation.

- Observation: physical planning can identify a derived relation's semantic shape but cannot capture its runtime resolver identity.
  Evidence: reverse-import planning knows it needs the complete direct-import topology, while JS/TS aliases depend on effective `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` state available only from the analyzer. The request fingerprint and runtime configuration fingerprint must therefore remain separate key dimensions.

- Observation: `unit_children` is normalized SQL topology, but the first experiment was not an end-to-end equivalent candidate for the current `Members` consumer.
  Evidence: the prototype could bulk-remap and freeze adjacency, but its lookup returned edge IDs instead of rich `CodeUnit` values, did not bind exact generation/completeness through publication, and used a global hash remap despite dense per-blob unit keys. It was retained only long enough to capture a negative-control measurement, then removed.

- Observation: the mutable request executor cannot be split safely at an arbitrary DAG edge.
  Evidence: semantic branches share adaptive budget state, partial request caches, declaration indexes, reference/call caches, and the resumable import graph. M4 therefore limits the parallel operator to one root union with two distinct direct seed dependencies, executes those seeds in isolated states, and merges every observable in authored order. Shared, stepped, nested, and derived-layer shapes remain serial.

- Observation: preserving fair budgets under concurrency requires ordered admission, not merely atomically adding global counters.
  Evidence: the sequential contract reserves a share for every later branch and lets it consume an earlier branch's unused share only after that branch finishes. The M4 coordinator admits scan/fact/row work against the same authored allowances, lets only later branches wait for roll-forward, wakes waits on cancellation or worker failure, and reproduces exact work/diagnostic parity under both roll-forward and exhaustion.

- Observation: the first apparent 257-file exact-union crossover was a benchmark artifact.
  Evidence: review found that the cold candidates shared one persistence root and that the timed calls omitted production query-scope caching. The first strategy could persist structural facts for the second, while repeated `analyzed_files()` work distorted serial and parallel differently. That evidence was discarded. The corrected harness uses strategy-private durable stores, includes query-scope setup/cleanup, and asserts equal positive cold extraction with zero hydration.

- Observation: corrected parallel performance depends on workload and cache state, with no stable production selector in the measured range.
  Evidence: in final stable-identity reversed rounds at 257, 513, and 1,001 TypeScript files, exact cold results changed sign at every scale, exact warm medians changed sign at 513 files, and broad warm medians changed from negative at every scale to positive at every scale. Absolute timings varied by several multiples under system load while result, work, cache, and source-fingerprint assertions remained equal. Bifrost has no pre-execution cache/cardinality signal that isolates those regimes, so production Auto remains sequential.

- Observation: scheduler setup, cancellation, and panic paths need first-class accounting and wakeup behavior even for a two-branch experiment.
  Evidence: adversarial review found worker setup overlapping task timing, misleading cancellation counters, a partial-spawn barrier deadlock, a branch-panic budget-wait deadlock, and cancelled-prefix telemetry loss. The retained scheduler uses a fallible abortable ready/release gate, honest task-elapsed and observed-cancellation fields, panic-triggered coordinator failure, and full completed-worker telemetry folding.

- Observation: execution mode is a root output control, not part of semantic plan identity.
  Evidence: one declarative `CodeQueryExecutionMode` registry entry now drives JSON decoding, RQL `(explain QUERY)` and `(profile QUERY)` wrappers, source diagnostics, hover, MCP schema, and editor highlighting. The decoder rejects nested controls and policy selectors, while canonical plan projection omits the mode so identical semantic queries retain identical logical identity.

- Observation: the internal profiler is not a safe public wire contract.
  Evidence: its v4 evidence, fingerprints, generation labels, suffix flags, and worker-overlap fields describe implementation mechanics and can evolve with the benchmark harness. M5 projects them into explicit `bifrost_code_query_explain/v1` and `bifrost_code_query_profile/v1` DTOs with typed logical and physical plans, deterministic cache layers, nested timings, work, bounded scheduling, and operator observations.

- Observation: supported hosts have different cancellation and presentation contracts.
  Evidence: the public Rust cancellable request API can return a profile with cancellation-safe partial rows and operator termination observations. LSP cancellation must instead return `RequestCancelled`; when a profile completes normally, VS Code prints the complete versioned report while keeping the exact nested ordinary rows navigable in its results tree. The REPL similarly renders ordinary rows plus the full report rather than a lossy summary.

- Observation: profile totals are executor-core measurements, not end-to-end client latency.
  Evidence: `timings_ns.total` starts after analyzer query-scope setup and ends before scope cleanup, public DTO projection, serialization, transport, or host initialization. M5 documentation names those exclusions and also distinguishes explain's analyzer-data-free planning phase from a CLI host that initializes and indexes its workspace before the request.

## Decision Log

- Decision: keep the authored `CodeQueryPlan` frontend unchanged in the first milestone and lower it into a new internal `LogicalQueryPlan`.
  Rationale: JSON, RQL, schema validation, editor support, and public clients already agree on this semantic IR. Separating execution does not require another public syntax migration.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: represent the logical plan as an arena of typed dense node IDs with explicit `Seed`, `Step`, `Set`, and terminal `Limit` nodes.
  Rationale: arena IDs make dependencies cheap to reference, make shared seeds a real DAG rather than duplicated tree nodes, provide stable profile identities, and keep traversal bounded by the existing 64-node and depth-16 parser contract.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: intern exact repeated seeds by the existing canonical structured seed key, while retaining ordered dependency edges for every branch occurrence.
  Rationale: two branches may share seed materialization but still need distinct branch provenance, budgets, and downstream steps. Sharing the seed node exposes reusable work without collapsing semantic branch edges.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: make physical set choices explicit as `SequentialUnion`, `SequentialIntersection`, and `SequentialExcept` before adding alternatives.
  Rationale: a concrete physical operator boundary is independently explainable and testable now and later permits `ParallelUnion` or a dense-ID set implementation without changing parsing or logical semantics.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: preserve the current deterministic evaluation, provenance, cancellation, truncation, and fair roll-forward budget behavior in Milestone 1.
  Rationale: the first refactor establishes measurement seams. Concurrency and cost policy must not be entangled with proving semantic parity.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: instrument before selecting scheduling thresholds.
  Rationale: branch cost depends on cold versus warm state, repository and language mix, output cardinality, shared dependency contention, and merge overhead. Semantic labels such as `union` or `imports_of` are not sufficient cost estimates.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: use exact versioned derived-layer cache keys and publish only complete immutable values.
  Rationale: a cache key must distinguish workspace/store generation, graph kind, projection or filter, resolver configuration, and representation version. Partial or cancelled graph builds cannot support complete negative conclusions and must not enter the ready cache.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: do not wire SQL or `CompactDirectedGraph` into the first milestone.
  Rationale: the store currently serializes access through one connection mutex, existing graph/snapshot shapes do not carry the scheduler lifecycle, and prior experiments show that compacting the final adjacency can miss the resolver-dominated cost. Profiling must identify the exact stable intermediate first.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: when a SQL-backed graph experiment is justified, use minimal ordered projections, a sparsity-aware persistent-to-dense remap, exact preallocation, count/prefix-sum/scatter adjacency, and one canonical payload table referenced by both orientations.
  Rationale: these techniques minimize SQL decoding, hashing, sorting, allocation, and payload duplication while retaining Bifrost's typed semantic identities. A density guard avoids allocating memory proportional to a sparse persistent ID maximum.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: profile repeated DAG-node executions by both shared node ID and stable authored branch-slot path.
  Rationale: node identity describes reusable logical work; branch path describes the invocation that owns budget admission, provenance, diagnostics, and later scheduler placement. Keeping both prevents parallel completion order from becoming accidental attribution.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: make profiling an explicit opt-in collector and record operator disposition separately from forwarded row cardinality and aggregated result status.
  Rationale: normal queries should not pay measurement overhead, while a skipped parent may legitimately forward a cancelled child's terminal-domain partial rows. A disposition plus operator-local and propagated status represents that case without claiming the parent produced those rows.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: keep the M2 executor sequential and model only an explicitly idealized perfect-overlap lower bound for eligible branches.
  Rationale: there is no scheduler, dependency single-flight, or bounded parallel operator yet. Assuming unchanged set/rendering work and zero scheduler contention makes the projection useful for ranking experiments without misrepresenting it as an A/B result. Real sequential-versus-parallel measurement remains Milestone 4 work.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: expose structural-facts materialization outcome through a defaulted provider method and scope profile counters to seed-path observations.
  Rationale: global provider deltas include structural-facts lookups performed inside semantic resolvers and cannot distinguish memory reuse, persisted hydration, extraction, or unavailability for a specific seed operator. The default preserves third-party provider compatibility while the tree-sitter provider supplies exact outcomes.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: preserve relation-exhaustion state when replaying incomplete request-local reference caches.
  Rationale: allowing a sibling to run later steps over partial reference rows can produce downstream values that appear complete. This is a correctness repair uncovered by M2 completeness instrumentation, not a scheduling optimization; the profile's separate incomplete counters remain telemetry-only.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: keep the measurement harness internal and ignored, emit versioned machine-readable raw samples, and record the summarized evidence in `.agents/docs/issue-918-code-query-execution-benchmark-2026-07-20.md`.
  Rationale: normal test runs should remain deterministic and fast, while decision runs need exact tree, machine, compiler, limits, query, result digest, cache contract, and order provenance. An internal harness can evolve with the physical profile until Milestone 5 defines a public surface.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: do not choose a scheduling threshold or SQL-to-memory graph candidate from the M2 synthetic results.
  Rationale: the benchmark omits real scheduler contention, per-request CPU time, RSS/retained bytes, persisted reopen, asymmetric branches, and real-repository fanout. It validates instrumentation and nominates later experiments; it cannot promote or discard a production representation.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-20 / Codex

- Decision: extract `CompleteValueCache<K, V>` from the semantic artifact cache and keep ready-value retention and same-key flights in one shared lifecycle.
  Rationale: derived values and semantic artifacts need identical leader, waiter, cancellation, retry, oversize handoff, and complete-only publication semantics. One implementation also closes the ready-publication/flight-reservation race consistently.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: make exact key construction the responsibility of each concrete derived-layer owner, and do not retain an unbound production runtime key after discarding the only M3 candidate.
  Rationale: workspace mount, canonical store generations, content/overlay state, layer kind, projection/filter, representation version, and resolver configuration can each independently change validity. The generic cache documents that contract and a fake composite key proves every dimension plus generation cutover. No current layer can honestly construct the whole identity, so a speculative shared key type would only pretend exactness.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: annotate only `ImportersOf` with the complete direct-import-topology request in M3.
  Rationale: reverse traversal requires a complete project-local relation, whereas `ImportsOf` materializes only its dynamic input frontier. The annotation exposes the future scheduler dependency without changing the serial executor or claiming that a production layer exists.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: discard the `unit_children` SQL graph prototype and retain only its evidence.
  Rationale: it was not nominated by M2, did not compare equivalent consumer outputs, and lacked exact publication validity. Keeping experiment-only code would add normal test compilation and schema maintenance without supporting a production path; the result does not justify the broader claim that SQL-backed graphs are slow.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: bump the internal execution profile and enclosing benchmark formats to version 2.
  Rationale: physical explain nodes now optionally serialize derived-layer request metadata. A version bump prevents consumers from assuming the v1 explain shape.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: implement parallel union through a request-local two-worker ready-task scheduler, not recursive Rayon spawning.
  Rationale: the operator submits only already-ready direct seed dependencies, workers never wait for work queued to their own pool, and a fixed scoped lifetime makes cancellation, panic propagation, deterministic joining, and profile accounting explicit. A fallible ready/release gate prevents setup overlap and partial-spawn deadlock.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: preserve authored fair-budget semantics with an ordered synchronized coordinator.
  Rationale: independent branch-local limits would either overspend the request or deny later branches the unused capacity they receive sequentially. Admission before committed scan/fact/row work plus ordered roll-forward preserves both the global ceiling and exact branch diagnostics.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: keep the first parallel eligibility boundary to two distinct direct seed leaves and merge all public and profile state in authored order.
  Rationale: more general branches share mutable partial caches and resolver state whose concurrent ownership is not yet safe. The narrow boundary proves the physical/scheduler contract without masking those dependencies or changing provenance.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: retain `ParallelUnion` as an independently selectable internal alternative but keep production Auto sequential.
  Rationale: the corrected v4 A/B found no stable cold-and-warm crossover that can be identified before execution. Exact and broad outcomes changed with cache state, candidate order, and system load in ways the planner cannot currently observe. A measured negative policy is safer than a machine-local threshold.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: version the internal execution profile and both ignored benchmark envelopes as v4.
  Rationale: M4 adds scheduler observations and renames cancellation/task elapsed fields to state their overlap and execution semantics honestly. The candidate-neutral benchmark schema also prevents Auto's sequential control timings from being serialized as parallel work.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: expose one schema-authoritative root `execution_mode` with `results` as the default and RQL wrappers for `explain` and `profile`.
  Rationale: one enum keeps JSON, RQL, validation, MCP, CLI, Python, LSP, and editor behavior aligned. Root-only placement prevents an output preference from changing branch semantics or entering static-analysis policy identity.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: preserve the ordinary serialized response exactly and nest that exact result inside profile.
  Rationale: an untagged `CodeQueryResponse::Results` avoids adding an enum envelope or report allocations to existing calls. Profile can add observations without changing ordering, diagnostics, provenance, truncation, or completion, and tests compare the nested result against the ordinary JSON value.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: publish explicit v1 explain/profile projections rather than serializing the internal v4 plan and profiler structs.
  Rationale: public consumers need stable semantic stages and typed metrics, not benchmark evidence, cache fingerprints, generation details, or executor-only state. Separate versioned DTOs let the implementation evolve without accidental wire changes.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: centralize shared plan, work, response, and presentation mechanics without merging the internal and public DTOs.
  Rationale: the duplicated mechanics had multiple real consumers and could drift, while the separate DTOs remain the compatibility firewall that prevents internal v4 evidence from leaking into the stable public v1 wire contract. The cleanup therefore consumes internal snapshots into public projections instead of collapsing their ownership.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: expose cooperative cancellation through the public Rust request API while preserving normal LSP cancellation errors.
  Rationale: an embedded caller owns the token and can use a cancellation-safe partial profile; an LSP client expects its cancelled request to terminate with the protocol error. Documenting both avoids implying that every transport delivers partial telemetry.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

- Decision: document production `Auto` as sequential and do not expose a force-parallel request control.
  Rationale: the M4 operator and harness prove a bounded alternative, but the reversed cold/warm results provide no stable pre-execution selector. Public explain reports the selected production plan without turning an evidence-only candidate into a user policy knob.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-21 / Codex

## Outcomes & Retrospective

Milestone 1 is complete. Parsed JSON and RQL now converge on a dense dependency-first logical DAG with exact shared seed nodes, then select a one-to-one physical plan with explicit seed, step, sequential set, and root-limit operators. The existing query path executes through that plan while preserving authored branch order, fair budget roll-forward, cache replay and charging, provenance, diagnostics, cancellation checkpoints, intermediate-step exhaustion, and the global `limit + 1` probe.

The internal opt-in profile carries a semantic physical explanation, stable shared node and branch-invocation identities, self-time, input and forwarded output cardinality, disposition, local clipping, propagated truncation/cancellation, and `peak_concurrency = 1`. Ordinary query and policy execution leave profiling disabled. Review found and corrected explain-semantic loss, invocation ambiguity, skipped-operator status, unconditional instrumentation overhead, hidden set clipping, and forwarded partial-row accounting.

Validation passed with 5 execution-plan tests, 85 structural query tests, 3 focused profile tests, all 73 `code_query_pipelines` tests, `cargo fmt --all`, `git diff --check`, and pinned-toolchain `cargo-clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`. No SQL loader, graph cache, scheduler, guessed parallel threshold, public profile surface, or new dependency was added. Those remain explicitly gated by Milestones 2 through 5.

Milestone 2 is complete. The opt-in profile now separates planning, execution, rendering, operator self-time, inline dependency execution, dependency wait, merge, and scheduler overhead; reconciles execution and rendering work; records input, visited, expanded, discarded, and output cardinality; estimates temporary container capacity; and attaches typed cancellation, budget, terminal-cap, result-limit, unsupported-analysis, and incomplete-analysis markers. Cache observations distinguish request-local seed results, exact seed-path structural-facts outcomes, inbound/outbound references, incoming/outgoing calls, and forward/reverse imports, including completeness and replay counts. The serial executor continues to report one peak worker and zero wait/scheduler time.

Final adversarial review caught two false-complete telemetry paths before checkpointing. Call-cache completeness now derives from typed call-relation diagnostic impact as well as truncation/cancellation, and import-cache completeness treats unsupported source files as cached-but-incomplete for both orientations. Focused regressions cover incomplete call build/replay, incomplete incoming call replay, advisory call ambiguity, and unsupported PHP forward/reverse import build/replay.

The ignored release benchmark covers TypeScript and Java, 16- and 128-file branch scales, exact and broad queries, identical and distinct branches, shared reference traversal, shared import topology, fresh-analyzer first requests, and same-analyzer later requests. Two final reversed-order rounds on an Apple M4 showed large distinct exact idealized overlap headroom of 49.73–49.80 percent and large distinct broad headroom of 14.35–14.40 percent. Paired profile-collection overhead for the large cases stayed between -0.77 and +0.22 percent. A temporary four-round public-API harness compared the exact M1 checkpoint with M2, preserved every result digest, and observed combined ordinary-path median deltas from -0.32 to +1.82 percent.

The profile also uncovered and fixed partial reference-cache replay that allowed a sibling to continue later pipeline steps after the cached relation had exhausted its budget. A regression now proves the incomplete sibling remains halted. This is the only intentional ordinary-result semantic correction in M2; it prevents a partial cached relation from being treated as complete.

Final validation passed with 5 execution-plan tests plus the ignored benchmark registration, 85 structural query tests, all 40 structural search tests including 11 focused profile cases, the exact structural-facts outcome test, all 73 `code_query_pipelines` tests, both optimized benchmark rounds, `cargo fmt --all`, `git diff --check`, and pinned-toolchain `cargo-clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.

No threshold was selected. The reported headroom is an idealized wall-time projection with zero scheduler cost, not measured parallel execution or CPU-capacity evidence. The fixtures do not measure RSS, retained bytes, persisted reopen, asymmetric branches, high-fanout real repositories, or real scheduler contention, so they neither promote nor discard a SQL-backed graph layer. At the M2 checkpoint, Milestone 3 remained responsible for exact dependency keys and cancellation-aware complete-value single-flight; Milestone 4 remains responsible for actual bounded sequential/parallel A/B measurements and policy selection.

Milestone 3 is complete. `CompleteSemanticArtifactCache` now delegates ready-value retention and same-key flight coordination to one generic `CompleteValueCache<K, V>`. Leaders build outside locks and publish only complete immutable `Arc` values; dropped error, cancellation, and incomplete paths remove the exact flight and wake a retry; cancelled followers leave leaders alone; and oversize values reach current followers without bypassing the bounded ready cache. Review also caught and fixed a zero-weight hole in the generalized Moka weigher.

The cache contract requires each concrete derived-layer owner to bind workspace identity, canonical storage generations, content/overlay state, layer kind, exact projection/filter shape, resolver configuration, and representation version. A fake composite key proves every dimension and generation invalidation. Because no M3 graph candidate could construct that full identity, no speculative production runtime-key type remains. Physical `ImportersOf` nodes instead carry an explicit complete direct-import-topology request recipe; frontier-scoped `ImportsOf` nodes do not. The internal profile and enclosing benchmark formats are version 2 for the added physical-explain metadata.

The only normalized SQL topology, `unit_children`, was measured as a deliberately small negative control and then removed. The release run reported a 1.252 ms SQL scan, 0.034 ms remap/freeze, and 1.370 ms invalidation rebuild for 140 vertices and 120 edges, but the nearest current traversal returned only 100 rich results. The mismatch was one file-scope-to-top-level-class edge per synthetic file, and the prototype also lacked exact generation/integrity publication. These timings therefore do not promote the candidate and do not support a general rejection of SQL-to-CSR techniques.

Final validation passed 7 generic lifecycle/key tests, all 15 semantic-service tests, 7 execution-plan tests with the ignored benchmark registered, all 40 structural-search tests, all 73 `code_query_pipelines` tests, the ignored optimized negative-control run, `cargo fmt --all`, `git diff --check`, and pinned-toolchain `cargo-clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`. No SQL migration, production graph cache, scheduler, parallel operator, scheduling threshold, or public profile surface was added. Milestone 4 remains responsible for bounded scheduling and real sequential-versus-parallel A/B policy.

Milestone 4 is complete. `ParallelUnion` is now an independently selectable
physical alternative for one root union with exactly two distinct direct seed
leaves. A request-local two-worker scheduler dispatches only ready tasks,
bounds concurrency, joins deterministically, and records queue, worker,
coordinator, dispatch, budget-wait, cancellation-observation, and peak-worker
telemetry. Its fallible ready/release gate cannot strand workers after partial
spawn failure. A panicking branch fails the fair-budget coordinator and wakes
every waiter before the panic resumes.

Parallel branches execute in isolated request state, while one ordered
coordinator preserves the sequential four-lane fair reservations and
roll-forward allowances before work is committed. Results, diagnostics,
provenance, request-cache observations, work counters, and operator profiles
merge in authored order. Completed-worker telemetry is retained after an
authored cancellation prefix, while public partial rows still stop at that
prefix. Focused tests prove exact serial/parallel parity under ordinary
roll-forward and global-budget exhaustion, live cancellation, cancellation and
worker failure during budget waits, unsafe-shape fallback, rooted-path safety,
bounded concurrency, and deterministic task results.

The corrected v4 release harness measures strategy-private cold durable stores
and same-analyzer warm reuse inside the production query-scope lifecycle. It
asserts equal public results, detailed evidence, work, source fingerprint, and
cache outcomes for every pair. Stable case identity reverses cold candidate
order between rounds 12 and 13. At 257, 513, and 1,001 TypeScript files, exact
cold results changed sign at every scale and broad warm medians changed from
negative at every scale to positive at every scale. Absolute timings varied by
several multiples under system load. No observable pre-execution signal can
select the favorable regime, so production `Auto` deliberately remains
sequential. The scheduler, forced alternative, profile, parity suite, and A/B
harness remain as evidence-bearing infrastructure for a future selector.

No bitmap-backed representation was added because no stable dense identity
domain was established. At the M4 checkpoint, no explain/profile control had
yet been added to a public query surface; that work was completed in M5.

Final M4 validation passed 11 execution/scheduler tests with 2 ignored
benchmarks registered, all 85 structural-query tests, all 46 structural-search
tests, all 73 CodeQuery pipeline tests, both corrected release benchmark
rounds, formatting, strict pinned-toolchain all-target/all-feature Clippy, and
`git diff --check`. The full `nlp,python` executable suite also passed (the
library reported 1,505 passed and 6 ignored, followed by every integration
binary). On this macOS host, Cargo initially selected Homebrew `rustdoc` after
rustup `rustc` had built the dependencies; the resulting compiler-metadata
mismatch was environmental, and the zero-example doctest passed once both
compiler tools were pinned to the same rustup 1.96.0 toolchain.

Milestone 5 is complete. JSON queries accept the root `execution_mode` enum and
RQL accepts `(explain QUERY)` and `(profile QUERY)` through the declarative
schema, parser, canonicalizer, source validation, hover, policy rejection, and
TextMate grammar. `results` remains the default and serializes as the exact
pre-M5 `CodeQueryResult`. Explain performs logical lowering and physical
selection without constructing analyzer query state. Profile executes once and
nests that exact ordinary result with stable public v1 plan, timing, work,
cache, scheduling, and operator projections.

The same contract is available through the MCP tool schema and runtime,
one-shot CLI/query files, REPL, top-level Rust API, Python client models, LSP,
and VS Code. Profiled LSP rows remain navigable while the output channel shows
the complete report. A public cancellable Rust entry point returns partial
profile observations; LSP cancellation retains its protocol error semantics.
The docs include executable JSON/RQL examples, the exact M4 absolute timing
table and repository scales, the production-sequential policy, and separate
evidence classifications for the ineligible bitmap representation, discarded
SQL negative control, and unsafe arbitrary graph splitting.

Final M5 validation passed formatting, `git diff --check`, strict pinned-
toolchain all-target/all-feature Clippy, and the full `nlp,python` Rust suite.
The library reported 1,519 passed and 5 ignored; the `bifrost` binary reported
22 passed, including the complete REPL profile regression; every integration
binary and doc-test target also passed. The native Python suite passed 51 tests,
the VS Code formatting/typecheck/lint/compile/license/grammar/unit gates passed
60 tests, and the Astro build rendered 56 pages and checked 5,210 internal
links. Browser inspection of the Explain and Profile page found no horizontal
overflow or console warnings. Final specialist re-review reported no remaining
P0-P3 findings.

Post-M5 housekeeping removed the remaining narrow multi-consumer drift points.
Standalone explain and execution now share physical-plan selection; public
scheduling capacity comes from the selected plan and configured worker bound;
ordinary and profiled work share one budget snapshot; and internal plan data is
consumed into the stable public projection without cloning JSON payloads. Core
and REPL text rendering share provenance and diagnostic presentation, LSP and
other transports share exact response decomposition, and MCP `query_file`
exclusions derive from the authoritative inline property set.

The Python client now owns one execution-mode type and one strict public-v1
cache-layer decoder. Undocumented internal-v4 cache aliases are intentionally
not accepted as public-v1 input. Final review also retained the immediate LSP
cancellation guard and typed REPL report rendering so centralization does not
delay cancellation or reorder the human-facing report. Validation passed the
full feature-enabled Rust executable and integration suite, the explicitly
pinned zero-example doctest, 56 Python tests, focused response/REPL/LSP tests,
formatting, strict all-target/all-feature Clippy, and `git diff --check`.

## Context and Orientation

The public query frontend lives under `src/analyzer/structural/query/`. `ir.rs` defines `CodeQuery`, the recursively authored `CodeQueryPlan`, `CodeQuerySeed`, typed `QueryStep` values, and set operators. `decode.rs` validates canonical JSON, `sexp.rs` lowers RQL, and `json.rs` produces canonical structured forms. A `CodeQueryPlan` node currently contains either a seed or a set composition followed by zero or more typed steps. `CodeQuery` owns the result limit and rendering detail.

The current executor is `src/analyzer/structural/search.rs`. `execute_internal` lowers the authored query with `LogicalQueryPlan::lower`, selects a `PhysicalQueryPlan`, constructs `QueryExecutionState`, and recursively executes physical node IDs through `execute_plan`. `execute_seed` scans deterministic candidate files and materializes structural rows. `apply_plan_steps` runs semantic traversals. `fair_branch_limits` reserves part of the remaining request budget for each authored branch. `combine_set_rows` implements exact typed union, intersection, and subtraction while preserving deterministic order and bounded provenance. Rendering happens only after internal execution and remains outside the physical operators.

The name `QueryPlan` in `src/analyzer/structural/planner.rs` refers only to seed-scan anchor pruning. It is not a whole-query logical or physical plan. New types therefore use the explicit names `LogicalQueryPlan` and `PhysicalQueryPlan` to avoid confusing the two responsibilities.

A directed acyclic graph, or DAG, is a set of nodes connected by one-way dependency edges with no cycles. An arena stores all nodes in one vector and refers to them with small typed integer IDs. In this plan every logical dependency points to an earlier arena node, so node order is also a valid execution postorder and easy to validate.

A physical operator is the implementation chosen for one logical operation. For example, logical union says which sets must be combined, while `SequentialUnion` executes and merges the branches in authored order on the current thread. `ParallelUnion` implements the same logical operation through the bounded scheduler and remains independently selectable for tests and measurement while production Auto selects sequential execution.

A derived layer is an expensive reusable analysis value such as a complete import topology, hierarchy relation, call relation, or another resolver intermediate. Single-flight means that concurrent requests for one exact key elect one builder while other consumers wait or yield; all consumers receive the same complete immutable value. Failed, partial, stale, or cancelled construction is not published.

The reusable storage primitives live in `src/compact_graph.rs`. The persisted analyzer store is in `src/analyzer/store/mod.rs`, its schema migrations are under `migrations/cache/`, and structural snapshot hydration is split across `src/analyzer/structural/provider.rs`, `facts.rs`, and `tree_sitter_analyzer.rs`. The reusable complete-value lifecycle is in `src/analyzer/complete_value_cache.rs`; `src/analyzer/semantic/service.rs` is its first production client. The canonical shared-payload bidirectional graph construction pattern is `ControlFlowGraph` in `src/analyzer/semantic/ir.rs`.

The most important behavioral regression suite is `tests/code_query_pipelines.rs`. Existing tests cover exact endpoint identity, branch order, nested composition, common suffix steps, identical complete and truncated seed reuse, fair budgets, rejected-work charging, resumable import graph work, cancellation, and applying the global result limit only after composition.

## Plan of Work

Milestone 1 adds a storage-neutral sequential plan spine. Create `src/analyzer/structural/execution/plan.rs` and its module boundary. Define `LogicalQueryNodeId`, `LogicalQueryPlan`, and explicit logical nodes for seeds, individual typed steps, set operations, and the root limit. Lower a validated `CodeQuery` in bounded postorder. Reuse the existing structured seed cache key to intern exact repeated seeds; keep repeated dependency IDs in set input arrays so branch occurrence and order remain visible. Record each node's terminal `QueryValueKind` and validate that every dependency ID is smaller than its consumer.

Lower the logical arena one-to-one into `PhysicalQueryPlan`. Select `SeedScan`, `PipelineStep`, `SequentialUnion`, `SequentialIntersection`, `SequentialExcept`, and `Limit` operators. Add a deterministic serializable explain model containing physical node ID, logical node ID, operator, typed output domain, and ordered dependencies.

Refactor `search.rs::execute_internal` into the explicit stages `validate and lower -> physical selection -> sequential physical execution -> render`. Execute seed, step, set, and limit nodes through the existing helpers and shared `QueryExecutionState`; do not change those helpers' semantics. Wrap node execution with a structured internal observation containing node ID, operator, elapsed wall time, input rows, output rows, truncation, and cancellation. The request profile contains the physical explain model and `peak_concurrency`, which is exactly one for this milestone. Existing public `query_code` output remains unchanged.

Milestone 2 turns the profile skeleton into decision-grade measurement. Add cache hit, miss, and wait counts; dependency execution and wait time; rows or edges visited; merge time; scheduling overhead; temporary allocation estimates where practical; and cancellation/early-termination markers. Extend the benchmark harness with representative composed queries and versioned machine-readable results. Cover fresh-analyzer and same-analyzer-later cache states, distinct and identical branches, small and large outputs, shared graph prerequisites, multiple synthetic workspace sizes, and TypeScript and Java. Keep physical execution sequential and calculate an explicitly idealized perfect-overlap lower bound only for complete distinct branches without shared derived dependencies. Do not introduce experimental parallel execution or publish a threshold here; repeated optimized sequential-versus-parallel A/B runs belong to Milestone 4 after Milestone 3 establishes complete-value single-flight.

Milestone 3 creates an exact shared-dependency contract and a promote-or-discard graph materialization experiment. Generalize the complete-value single-flight lifecycle from `CompleteSemanticArtifactCache` instead of duplicating leader, waiter, cancellation, retry, and publication logic. Each promoted layer-owned key must include workspace or store generation, derived-layer kind, projection/filter/configuration identity, and representation version. First prove with an in-memory fake layer that concurrent consumers cause one build, cancelled waiters do not cancel the leader, a failed leader wakes a retry, and incomplete results are never cached. Physical planning records only a plan-known request recipe; binding a runtime key remains the responsibility of an actual layer owner.

The production graph gate stopped at candidate eligibility: M2 identified no expensive resolved relation with stable persisted topology, and packed structural facts already had a dense warm representation. `unit_children` was measured only as a negative control. Its prototype exercised minimal SQL projection, dense remapping, count/prefix/scatter adjacency, and invalidation rebuild timing, but returned non-equivalent results and lacked exact publication validity, so it was deleted. The reported warm number is direct lookup reuse, not `CompleteValueCache` reuse or sibling contention. Cold/warm cache reuse and contention gates were intentionally not run because no valid layer survived to acquire a runtime key. Any future candidate must first be nominated by end-to-end profile evidence, then meet the original equivalent-result, exact-key, complete-publication, cold/warm, contention, retained-memory, and invalidation gates.

Milestone 4 adds the bounded scheduler and real physical alternatives. The scheduler owns a fixed parallelism budget and dispatches only ready DAG nodes. It must not recursively spawn arbitrary tasks from operators. Implement sequential and parallel union as separate physical operators over the same exact typed rows. Keep branch occurrence as edge metadata so shared node materialization can be reused while branch provenance is attached deterministically. Preserve the existing global budgets and reserve work for every branch; synchronize counter admission before committing scans or graph expansion. Propagate cancellation to queued and running work and ensure dependency waits cannot starve the executor. Measure cold and warm alternatives and select a production policy only from observable pre-execution evidence; the completed experiment retains sequential Auto because no stable selector survived. Add bitmap-backed set operations only for a domain with proven stable dense identities; do not coerce heterogeneous query domains into one global integer namespace.

Milestone 5 exposes and documents the result. Add supported `explain` and `profile` query wrappers or equivalent root controls through the declarative schema registry, RQL parser, JSON decoder, source diagnostics, hover, TextMate grammar, MCP schema, CLI/REPL, Python models, VS Code, and executable docs. Explain shows logical sharing, physical choices, and dependencies. Profile adds observations, cache behavior, waits, concurrency, cancellation, and budget use without changing ordinary result ordering. Document the benchmark-justified production-sequential policy with absolute elapsed times and repository scales, plus the rejected threshold, storage, and scheduling alternatives. Complete adversarial review and full validation.

## Concrete Steps

Work from `/Users/dave/.codex/worktrees/740b/bifrost` on the existing branch `918-modularise-query-planning-and-execution-for-measurable-parallel-scheduling`. Do not create or switch branches. The plan originally started at `ce79d33b`; before M3, the M1/M2 checkpoints were cleanly rebased onto `origin/master` at `a84d6df4`. Before M4 implementation, all three checkpoints were cleanly rebased onto `origin/master` at `0955e1c7`, producing M3 checkpoint `d6d0837f`. After M4 validation, the four-checkpoint series was cleanly rebased again onto current `origin/master` at `8f8a0ef7`, producing M3 checkpoint `cf920952`.

For Milestone 1, run:

    cargo fmt --all
    cargo test analyzer::structural::execution
    cargo test analyzer::structural::query
    cargo test --test code_query_pipelines
    rustup run 1.96.0 cargo-clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    git diff --check

For Milestone 2, run the focused semantic and profile gates:

    cargo fmt --all
    cargo test --lib analyzer::structural::execution
    cargo test --lib analyzer::structural::query
    cargo test --lib structural_facts_cache_reports_exact_materialization_outcomes
    cargo test --test code_query_pipelines
    rustup run 1.96.0 cargo-clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    git diff --check

Run the ignored optimized measurement twice with reversed order:

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off BIFROST_CODE_QUERY_BENCH_ROUND=0 \
      cargo test --release --lib code_query_execution_profile_measurement -- --ignored --nocapture
    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off BIFROST_CODE_QUERY_BENCH_ROUND=1 \
      cargo test --release --lib code_query_execution_profile_measurement -- --ignored --nocapture

Redirect the full JSON lines when preserving raw output; one default run is roughly two megabytes because every profiled sample retains its full operator plan and observations. Summarize, rather than commit, the raw output in `.agents/docs/issue-918-code-query-execution-benchmark-2026-07-20.md`.

If an isolated target is necessary, use `scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh`; never create a manually named Bifrost target directory in `/tmp`.

After the milestone implementation, update this plan's progress, discoveries, decisions, outcome, concrete validation evidence, and revision note. Review `git status --short` and the exact diff. Stage only this plan and files changed for the milestone, then create a multiline checkpoint commit explaining why the new boundary exists. Do not push or open a pull request unless explicitly requested.

For later benchmark work, use ignored configurable tests with versioned JSON result lines and repeat optimized candidate/baseline runs in alternating order. Record absolute times as well as percentages. Cold runs must start without a ready derived layer; warm runs must prove the exact generation-matched layer was reused; contention runs must prove sibling branches requested the same key.

For Milestone 3, run the focused lifecycle, key, explain, profile, and query regression gates:

    cargo fmt --all
    cargo test --lib complete_value_cache
    cargo test --lib analyzer::semantic::service::tests
    cargo test --lib analyzer::structural::execution
    cargo test --lib analyzer::structural::search::tests
    cargo test --test code_query_pipelines
    rustup run 1.96.0 cargo-clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    git diff --check

The discarded `unit_children` negative control was measured in an ignored optimized test before its experiment-only module was deleted:

    BIFROST_UNIT_CHILDREN_GRAPH_FILES=20 \
    BIFROST_UNIT_CHILDREN_GRAPH_MEMBERS=4 \
    BIFROST_UNIT_CHILDREN_GRAPH_ITERATIONS=3 \
    cargo test --release --lib \
      analyzer::store::graph_experiment::unit_children_graph_negative_control_benchmark \
      --no-default-features -- --ignored --exact --nocapture

For Milestone 4, run the scheduler, physical-plan, structural-search, query, and
integration gates:

    cargo fmt --all
    cargo test --lib analyzer::structural::execution --no-default-features
    cargo test --lib analyzer::structural::query --no-default-features
    cargo test --lib analyzer::structural::search::tests --no-default-features
    cargo test --test code_query_pipelines --no-default-features
    rustup run 1.96.0 cargo-clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    RUSTDOC=/Users/dave/.rustup/toolchains/1.96.0-aarch64-apple-darwin/bin/rustdoc \
    RUSTC=/Users/dave/.rustup/toolchains/1.96.0-aarch64-apple-darwin/bin/rustc \
    RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-undefined -C link-arg=dynamic_lookup' \
    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off \
      rustup run 1.96.0 cargo test --features nlp,python
    git diff --check

Run the corrected ignored release A/B with stable case identity in two rounds
to reverse cold candidate order and alternate every warm pair:

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off \
    BIFROST_CODE_QUERY_PARALLEL_BENCH_SIZES=128,256,500 \
    BIFROST_CODE_QUERY_BENCH_ITERATIONS=8 \

        --no-default-features -- --ignored --exact --nocapture --test-threads=1

    # Repeat with BIFROST_CODE_QUERY_BENCH_ROUND=13.

For Milestone 5, run the schema, public API, transport, editor, documentation,
Python, and repository gates:

    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    cargo test --lib public_ --no-default-features
    cargo test --test code_query_public_api --no-default-features

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --features nlp,python
    git diff --check

Render the built Explain and Profile page through the local Astro preview and
verify navigation, headings, code blocks, the measurement table, horizontal
overflow, and browser warnings rather than relying on the static build alone.

## Validation and Acceptance

Milestone 1 is accepted when equivalent JSON and RQL queries lower to identical logical explain structures; exact repeated seeds produce one seed node referenced by multiple branch edges; all dependency IDs precede their consumers; a union selects `SequentialUnion`; the root limit is explicit; and the structured execution profile reports deterministic operator identities and `peak_concurrency = 1`. The existing query pipeline suite must remain green, with no public result, ordering, provenance, diagnostic, truncation, cancellation, or budget change.

The complete issue is accepted when an explain view proves parsed, logical, physical, and scheduled stages are distinct; logical plans represent shared dependencies; physical implementations are selectable and independently tested; the scheduler bounds concurrency; union has measured sequential and parallel paths; the reusable complete-value lifecycle proves same-key single-flight; operator metrics are structured; profile exposes plan, timing, cardinality, cache behavior, waiting, and concurrency; benchmark artifacts compare cold/warm and sequential/parallel behavior across representative scales; the selected scheduling policy, including a measured decision not to promote a threshold, is justified with concrete measurements; and deterministic presentation, cancellation, and query budgets remain correct.

Graph materialization is accepted only when a behavior-parity test validates exact typed nodes and edges, corruption or stale-generation input cannot publish a ready snapshot, concurrent same-key consumers receive one shared `Arc`, and repeated measurements show a useful end-to-end win rather than only a faster final adjacency loop.

## Idempotence and Recovery

Plan lowering and execution are read-only over the analyzer. Re-running focused tests is safe and writes only normal Cargo artifacts and inline temporary projects. Node IDs are snapshot-local and must never be persisted or treated as semantic identities.

If the physical executor refactor changes any existing semantic test, stop and restore the prior behavior before adding concurrency. Do not relax the regression assertion or add an ignore annotation. Record the discovered coupling in this plan and make the sequential operator reproduce it explicitly.

If a single-flight leader fails, its permit must remove the in-flight entry and wake waiters so one may retry. If cancellation occurs, incomplete construction is discarded. If waiting could block work queued to the same bounded pool, change scheduling or the build executor; do not work around the deadlock by silently allowing unbounded threads.

If a SQL graph experiment regresses cold latency, memory, write amplification, or database size beyond its declared gate, remove or leave it behind an experiment-only path and record the result. Durable rows remain authoritative; an in-memory graph snapshot can always be rebuilt for the exact generation.

## Artifacts and Notes

Milestone 2 benchmark configuration, optimized medians, cache/work contracts,
ordinary-path M1 comparison, limitations, and the decision to defer threshold
selection are recorded in
`.agents/docs/issue-918-code-query-execution-benchmark-2026-07-20.md`.

Milestone 3 candidate selection, exact lifecycle/key contracts, raw optimized
negative-control evidence, experiment limitations, and the discard decision
are recorded in
`.agents/docs/issue-918-derived-layer-graph-experiment-2026-07-21.md`.

Milestone 4 scheduler semantics, fair-budget and cancellation contracts,
corrected paired measurements, rejected selector threshold, and retained
production policy are recorded in
`.agents/docs/issue-918-parallel-query-scheduling-2026-07-21.md`.

Milestone 5 public syntax and DTO boundaries, cross-surface behavior,
cancellation/presentation contracts, documentation evidence, and validation
are recorded in
`.agents/docs/issue-918-explain-profile-2026-07-21.md`.

The intended first-milestone plan shape for two identical union branches is:

    logical node 0: Seed(canonical foo query) -> structural_match
    logical node 1: Set(Union, inputs [0, 0]) -> structural_match
    logical node 2: Limit(input 1, count 20) -> structural_match

The physical explanation for the same query is:

    physical node 0: SeedScan, dependencies []
    physical node 1: SequentialUnion, dependencies [0, 0]
    physical node 2: Limit(20), dependencies [1]
    peak_concurrency: 1

The later SQL-to-memory freeze algorithm is:

    read minimal ordered node rows
    build typed semantic arena and persistent-to-dense remap
    read minimal ordered edge rows and validate/remap endpoints
    count degrees for each orientation
    prefix-sum counts into row offsets
    scatter canonical edge IDs into outgoing/incoming rows
    validate offsets, endpoints, generation, and representation version
    publish Arc<immutable snapshot>
    release remap and construction buffers

Revision note (2026-07-20): Created the self-contained issue #918 plan after live issue inspection, current-code diagnosis, prior Bifrost graph/snapshot measurement review, and primary-source study of the reference repository. The plan deliberately starts with a sequential logical/physical execution spine and postpones SQL graph loading and parallel scheduling until structured profiles can justify them.

Revision note (2026-07-20, Milestone 1): Recorded the completed sequential plan spine, implicit recursive-executor state that had to become explicit, semantic explain and invocation-profile review fixes, opt-in instrumentation boundary, exact validation results, and the pinned Clippy invocation required by this machine's mixed rustup/Homebrew command lookup.

Revision note (2026-07-20, Milestone 2): Recorded the completed profile schema and cache lifecycle attribution, the partial-reference replay correctness repair, the versioned ignored benchmark, optimized reversed-order evidence, explicit idealized-headroom limits, ordinary-path M1 comparison, and the decision to leave single-flight, SQL promotion, real parallel execution, and policy selection to later milestones.

Revision note (2026-07-21, Milestone 3): Recorded the clean rebase onto current `origin/master`, generic complete-value lifecycle, exact layer-owned key contract and fake-key proof, reverse-import request annotation, versioned execution-profile/benchmark schemas for the added explain metadata, and the measured decision to delete rather than promote the non-equivalent `unit_children` SQL graph prototype. Milestone 4 remains the first scheduler and real sequential-versus-parallel A/B milestone.

Revision note (2026-07-21, Milestone 4): Recorded the clean rebase onto current `origin/master`, bounded ready-task scheduler, independent `ParallelUnion`, ordered fair-budget admission, cancellation and panic wakeups, deterministic authored merge, corrected query-scoped and persistence-isolated v4 A/B harness, stable reversed candidate ordering, and the measured decision to retain production-sequential Auto because no stable observable crossover survived. Milestone 5 remains responsible for supported explain/profile surfaces and final issue-level validation.

Revision note (2026-07-21, Milestone 5): Recorded the schema-authoritative root execution mode, stable public v1 projections, exact ordinary/profile result compatibility, top-level cancellable Rust API, MCP/CLI/REPL/Python/LSP/VS Code surfaces, rendered documentation and measured production-sequential policy, cross-surface adversarial fixes, and final issue-level validation.

Revision note (2026-07-21, post-M5 housekeeping): Recorded the centralized physical-plan selection and capacity, single work snapshot, consuming public projections, shared transport and presentation mechanics, schema-derived MCP exclusions, strict single-owner Python contract, and the review fixes preserving prompt LSP cancellation and typed REPL field order.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

In `src/analyzer/structural/execution/plan.rs`, Milestone 1 should provide types equivalent to:

    pub(crate) struct LogicalQueryPlan { ... }
    pub(crate) struct LogicalQueryNodeId(u32);
    pub(crate) enum LogicalQueryOperator {
        Seed(Box<CodeQuerySeed>),
        Step { input: LogicalQueryNodeId, step: QueryStep },
        Set { op: SetOperator, inputs: Box<[LogicalQueryNodeId]> },
        Limit { input: LogicalQueryNodeId, count: usize },
    }

    pub(crate) struct PhysicalQueryPlan { ... }
    pub(crate) struct PhysicalQueryNodeId(u32);
    pub(crate) enum PhysicalQueryOperator {
        SeedScan,
        PipelineStep,
        SequentialUnion,
        ParallelUnion,
        SequentialIntersection,
        SequentialExcept,
        Limit,
    }

The exact field visibility may remain private behind accessors. Each logical node carries its terminal `QueryValueKind`; each physical node points back to one logical node, retains ordered physical dependencies, and may carry a plan-known `DerivedLayerRequest`. `LogicalQueryPlan::lower(&CodeQuery)` validates and lowers the authored query. Production selection remains sequential; `PhysicalQueryPlan::select_with_parallel_union` can replace one independently chosen logical union for internal parity tests and the ignored A/B. `PhysicalQueryPlan::explain()` returns a deterministic serializable structure without borrowing internal arenas.

The internal profile types belong beside execution, not in MCP result models. Milestone 1 needs a request profile and per-operator observation sufficient to prove plan identity, elapsed wall time, cardinality, truncation, cancellation, and sequential peak concurrency. Later milestones extend this same model rather than adding a second profiler.

Do not add a new dependency for Milestone 1. Use the repository hash-map alias, `std::time::Instant`, existing cancellation and budget types, and current typed row/set helpers. M4 adds `BoundedReadyScheduler`, implemented with scoped standard threads and a fixed request-local worker limit; operators submit only ready tasks and do not recursively enqueue work. M3 extracted `CompleteValueCache<K, V>` from the semantic cache; future derived-layer owners must define their exact typed key next to the materializer and reuse this lifecycle rather than maintaining a second single-flight implementation.
