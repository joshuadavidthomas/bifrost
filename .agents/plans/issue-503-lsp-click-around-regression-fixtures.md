# Issue 503 LSP Click-Around Regression Fixtures

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, `Outcomes & Retrospective`, and `Timing Log` must be kept up to date as work proceeds.

This document follows `.agent/PLANS.md` from the repository root. Keep the current branch; do not create or switch branches. Fetch remote refs when needed, but do not rebase unless the user explicitly asks. Stage only files changed for each milestone and commit directly on the current branch after Brokk Guided Review findings for that milestone have been fixed.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Bifrost's LSP features should behave coherently when a user clicks around realistic relation-heavy projects, not just when one narrow reported coordinate is selected. This work adds a marker-driven regression layer that opens small multi-file fixtures through the real `bifrost --lsp` server and asserts the responses for each click site. A future analyzer change should be able to run these tests and see whether definition, references, implementation, type definition, hierarchy, hover, and intentionally ambiguous sites still produce the expected editor-visible behavior.

The work is test-first. Production analyzer changes are allowed only when a new click-around fixture exposes a real current bug. Such fixes must use structured analyzer and tree-sitter data; do not add regex or source-text fallback behavior to hide missing structured support.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: The existing `tests/common/lsp_client.rs` already supports the protocol operations needed by the harness: definition-style position requests, references, implementation, type definition, hover, and hierarchy helper calls.
  Evidence: `LspServer` exposes `text_document_position_response`, `references_response`, `implementation_response`, `type_definition_response`, `hover_response`, `prepare_hierarchy`, and `hierarchy_relation`.

- Observation: The first marker parser accepted any `<alnum>` marker and would have stripped ordinary generic syntax such as `List<String>`.
  Evidence: Brokk Guided Review flagged the issue, and `common::lsp_click::tests::milestone_0_marker_parser_preserves_generic_syntax` now proves `List<String>` remains in the cleaned source.

- Observation: The first caret-comment parser could corrupt fixtures by truncating the previous source line.
  Evidence: Brokk Guided Review flagged `target();` followed by `// ^call` as a deleting case. `common::lsp_click::tests::milestone_0_marker_parser_strips_caret_marker_line_without_deleting_target` now proves the marker line is stripped without deleting the target or following source.

- Observation: The harness must use UTF-16 character offsets, not Unicode scalar counts, because LSP positions are UTF-16.
  Evidence: Brokk Guided Review flagged this, and `common::lsp_click::tests::milestone_0_marker_parser_counts_utf16_columns` now covers a supplementary emoji before a marker.

- Observation: The Go LSP fixture exposed a cross-package reference overmatch for promoted embedded fields. Querying `service.Base.ID` through the LSP references path returned `worker.ID` and `svc.ID` even though definition lookup correctly resolved those selectors to `AuditLog.ID` and `Service.ID`.
  Evidence: The review-added LSP case `base field references include only semantically valid promoted use` failed with three locations. The lower-level regression `go_graph_strategy_respects_imported_embedded_field_promotion_precedence` reproduced the same three hits in the Go usage graph before the fix.

- Observation: The Rust LSP fixture initially documented default trait method calls and `Self::Output` associated-type uses as expected-empty results, but review correctly treated both as relation-heavy sites with structured targets available in the fixture.
  Evidence: Changing `file.describe()` to expect `Worker.describe` and `Self::Output` to expect `Worker.Output` exposed definition gaps. The Rust resolver now resolves typed receiver calls to default trait methods when no concrete impl method exists, and resolves `Self::Output` inside a trait method through the enclosing trait scope.

- Observation: The PHP fixture exposed asymmetric behavior between definition and references for interface-typed and factory-returned receivers.
  Evidence: `textDocument/definition` resolved `$notifier->notify()` to the interface method and, after the PHP definition fix, `$factory->notify()` to the concrete method, but references from `Notifier::notify` initially omitted both call sites. Review strengthened the exact references expectation, leading to PHP graph fixes for interface receiver matching and free-function factory return seeding.

- Observation: The Scala fixture exposed that `textDocument/definition` did not resolve an unqualified top-level member reached through a package wildcard import, even though the references graph already modeled wildcard-imported members.
  Evidence: The first Scala fixture run returned `null` for `helper()` under `import support.*`. The Scala definition resolver now checks wildcard import metadata and the declaration index's direct children before falling through to unresolved callable handling.

- Observation: The first Scala wildcard-import definition fix introduced two review-visible semantic risks: wildcard members could outrank enclosing members, and multiple wildcard imports exposing the same direct member could return multiple go-to-definition targets.
  Evidence: Brokk Guided Review flagged both risks. The final fixture includes `localHelper()` proving enclosing-member precedence and `AmbiguousImports.helper()` proving ambiguous package wildcard imports return empty.

- Observation: The Java fixture exposed that interface method references did not include overriding declarations or concrete receiver calls through implementation types.
  Evidence: Strengthening `Task.run` references to expect `EmailTask.run`, `task.run()`, and `email.run()` initially returned only `task.run()`. The Java usage graph now builds a method-family owner set from type hierarchy descendants/ancestors, matches receiver types against that set, and records related method declarations.

- Observation: The C# fixture exposed two definition gaps around property references that the usage graph already modeled: object initializer labels and unqualified member writes from another partial type part.
  Evidence: `new EventRecord { Name = "created" }` and `Name = value` in the second partial file initially returned `null` from `textDocument/definition`. The C# definition resolver now recognizes object initializer labels structurally and checks same-owner members, including partial type parts, for unqualified identifiers before falling back to type lookup.

- Observation: The first C# definition fix was too broad in two review-visible ways: bare same-owner lookup could treat a named argument label as a member reference, and object initializer labels could resolve through ambiguous imported type owners.
  Evidence: Brokk Guided Review flagged `Configure(Name: value)` inside a class with a `Name` property and `using Alpha; using Beta; new Widget { Name = "x" }` as concrete failure shapes. The final C# regressions assert both return no definition, object initializer syntax detection is shared with the C# graph scanner, and initializer definition now requires exactly one visible owner.

- Observation: C++ out-of-line method references report the definition range at the qualified owner start rather than at the method-name token used by go-to-definition.
  Evidence: Strengthening the C++ fixture with `Derived::tick` and `Base::tick` references initially failed because references returned the `Derived`/`Base` range in `Derived::tick` and `Base::tick`; the final fixture uses separate reference markers for those LSP ranges while retaining method-name markers for definition lookup.

- Observation: JavaScript declaration collection materialized returned object members such as `makeToolbox.format`, but definition lookup did not infer that a local initialized from `makeToolbox()` had that returned-object surface.
  Evidence: Adding `const toolbox = makeToolbox(); toolbox.format(widget);` to the Milestone 8 LSP fixture initially returned `null`. `jsts_local_receiver_value_owner_candidates` now resolves call-expression initializers through the import-aware callee resolver and expands the callee's materialized return surface.

- Observation: TypeScript LSP references for type-alias object members include typed reads and contextual object literal keys, but not contextual callback parameter member reads in this fixture.
  Evidence: Strengthening `Payload.value` references returned `input.value` in both typed method bodies, the `payload.value` typed local read, and the `value:` contextual object key. It did not return `payload.value` inside the contextual callback parameter, even though definition lookup for that click site is supported. The final sweep changed this one assertion to require the proven locations while allowing the callback location as the only optional extra, so future callback-reference support will not fail without allowing arbitrary false positives.

- Observation: Python classmethod factory receiver inference needs an explicit return annotation to propagate the constructed receiver type through a reexported class alias.
  Evidence: The first Milestone 10 fixture run returned `null` for `account.label()` after `account = Account.guest()` until `guest` was annotated as returning `"User"`, matching the existing Python get-definition contract.

- Observation: Ruby namespaced factory receiver inference follows the existing `@ivar = Invoice.new` body shape for `Billing::Invoice.build`, while a bare `new` body did not propagate the local receiver type to a later mixin method call in the LSP fixture.
  Evidence: The first Milestone 11 fixture run returned `null` for `invoice.audit` after `invoice = Billing::Invoice.build` until `build` was changed to assign `Invoice.new`, matching the existing Ruby get-definition contract.

- Observation: Rust `textDocument/implementation` for trait implementer types returns struct name selections, not the whole struct declaration ranges, while Rust trait method implementation returns method-name selections.
  Evidence: The first Milestone 12 ignored stress run expected generated struct range markers for trait type implementations and failed with locations at each generated `JobN` name. Switching expectations to generated struct-name markers aligned the stress fixture with the existing LSP response shape.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Add the click-around harness under `tests/common/lsp_click.rs` instead of expanding `tests/bifrost_lsp_server.rs`.
  Rationale: The existing LSP server test file is already large, while the planned language fixtures need a reusable marker parser, response normalizer, and timing collector. A shared integration-test helper keeps language milestones compact.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Record per-request timing as diagnostic evidence, not as assertions.
  Rationale: Timing thresholds are flaky in CI and on developer machines. The timing data is still valuable for spotting relation-heavy regressions during review and for comparing stress fixtures.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Require inline markers to contain an underscore.
  Rationale: The requested examples use names such as `<call_run>`, while ordinary generic syntax commonly uses simple names such as `<String>` or `<T>`. Requiring an underscore preserves generic source text without changing the readable marker style used by the fixtures.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Keep the raw temp-root writer in the click harness instead of reusing `InlineTestProject`.
  Rationale: `InlineTestProject` is the right default for analyzer fixtures, but this harness must strip marker annotations before writing files and then start the real LSP process with the temp root. Reusing `LspServer` is the important shared behavior for this layer.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Make `ClickExpectation::Locations` exact by default.
  Rationale: Extra or duplicate LSP destinations are editor-visible regressions. The weaker contains-only behavior would let false positives through the click-around suite.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: For Go qualified receiver inference, require both the imported package qualifier and the compatible receiver type name to match.
  Rationale: The previous predicate treated any `service.X` expression as the target owner once `service` was the imported owner package. That incorrectly seeded locals from `service.NewWorker()` and `service.NewService()` while resolving references for `Base.ID`. Carrying a per-namespace receiver-name map preserves structured import matching without source-text fallbacks.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Treat expected-empty LSP cases as negative coverage only when the target is intentionally ambiguous or unsupported by the language surface, not when a precise structured target is present in the fixture.
  Rationale: Review found that expected-empty assertions for Rust default trait methods and associated types would have locked in fixable analyzer gaps while still claiming milestone coverage. The fixture now asserts the intended structured definitions and keeps unsupported or ambiguous cases for later milestones explicit.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Keep LSP definition and references inverse expectations aligned when a click site has a precise structured target.
  Rationale: In the PHP milestone, definition proved that interface-typed and factory-returned receiver calls had precise targets. Excluding those calls from exact references would have locked in an editor-visible inconsistency. The PHP graph now mirrors the structured receiver inference used by definition for these cases.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Cover Scala wildcard imports with a package wildcard top-level function in the LSP fixture, and leave object wildcard member import asymmetry outside this milestone.
  Rationale: Existing lower-level Scala graph coverage already covers object wildcard member imports. The LSP milestone needs a stable wildcard-import click case while keeping the main Scala 3 fixture focused on extensions, precedence, inherited trait defaults, ambiguity, and hierarchy.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Resolve Scala package-wildcard direct members only after explicit member imports and enclosing/source-ancestor members, and return no definition when more than one wildcard import contributes a matching direct member.
  Rationale: This keeps get-definition aligned with Scala lookup precedence and the graph resolver's ambiguity model. The helper uses shared Scala import candidate construction instead of a get-definition-only copy.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Treat Java method references for inherited/interface methods as a method family when structured hierarchy proves the related owner declares the same method name and arity.
  Rationale: Editor references from an interface or inherited method should include overriding declarations and receiver calls on concrete implementation types, while unrelated same-name methods remain excluded by owner-family and arity checks.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Keep C# method references receiver-specific in this milestone, while using `textDocument/implementation` to cover interface and override family relations.
  Rationale: Existing C# usage graph tests assert that `IHandler.Handle` references include the interface-typed receiver and `ConsoleHandler.Handle` references include the concrete receiver. The C# milestone therefore strengthens implementation coverage for `BaseHandler.Reset -> ConsoleHandler.Reset` rather than changing the reference contract as Java did.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

- Decision: Resolve C# object initializer labels only when the initializer type has exactly one visible logical owner.
  Rationale: Ambiguous imports should not be collapsed to whichever candidate happens to expose the member. This keeps get-definition aligned with the graph scanner's conservative ambiguity handling and avoids locking in arbitrary editor jumps.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

Milestone 0 is complete. The repository now has a reusable LSP click fixture helper, parser coverage for marker edge cases, a Java smoke fixture for definition/references/empty-result behavior, and timing capture. No production analyzer code was changed.

Milestone 0 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security found path traversal risk in fixture paths; senior-dev, duplication, architecture, and devops found overlapping issues around caret marker corruption, generic syntax collision, exactness of location assertions, UTF-16 column accounting, and hierarchy prepare panics bypassing normal shutdown. Accepted fixes validate fixture paths, require underscores in inline markers, fix caret marker line stripping, count UTF-16 columns, assert exact location lists, avoid `prepare_hierarchy` panics inside relation operations, and preserve LSP shutdown before assertion panics. The InlineTestProject reuse suggestion was not adopted for the reason recorded in the Decision Log.

Milestone 1 is complete. The Go fixture now covers imported factory receiver typing, embedded field and method promotion, explicit field shadowing, same-depth ambiguity returning empty, shallower-vs-deeper promotion, canonical embedded-member references, and promoted base-field references that exclude unrelated same-name selectors.

Milestone 1 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security, duplication, devops, and architecture found no blocking issues. Senior-dev found two coverage gaps in the Go milestone: the fixture did not directly test shallower-vs-deeper promotion for `worker.ID`, and it did not assert that references for `Base.ID` excluded shadowed selectors. Both were accepted. Adding the second case exposed the Go usage graph bug recorded above; the fix narrows qualified receiver inference using structured import/type data, and the lower-level graph regression plus the LSP fixture now pass.

Milestone 2 is complete. The Rust fixture now covers typed trait-method calls resolving to concrete impl methods, explicit trait-path UFCS resolving to the trait method, default trait methods resolving through implemented traits, unrelated same-name inherent methods, trait method references, trait method implementation lookup, trait type implementation lookup, type definition from a type annotation, type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes, associated type use resolution, and associated type implementation lookup.

Milestone 2 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security/correctness and devops found no issues. Duplication found repeated timing-summary boilerplate and weak associated-type coverage; senior-dev and architecture found that expected-empty default-method and associated-type cases hid precise structured relations. Accepted fixes add a local timing summary helper, assert the intended default trait method and `Self::Output` definitions, add `textDocument/implementation` coverage for the trait associated type, and fix Rust definition resolution with structured trait-associated lookup. Adjacent Rust go-to-definition and type-hierarchy suites pass.

Milestone 3 is complete. The PHP fixture now covers interface-typed receiver definitions, concrete receiver definitions, factory-returned receiver definitions, trait methods imported by class `use`, in-class trait method calls, unrelated same-name methods, interface references including implementation declarations and typed/factory/interface receiver calls, trait method references, and implementation lookup for interface methods and types.

Milestone 3 Brokk Guided Review outcome: devops found no issues. Security/correctness, senior-dev, duplication, and architecture all found that the interface method reference expectation undercounted `interface_notify_call` and/or `factory_notify_call`. Accepted fixes strengthened the exact reference expectation, added free-function factory return seeding to PHP get-definition and the PHP graph scanner, and changed PHP graph receiver matching so interface-typed receivers count as references to the interface method. Focused PHP LSP, PHP graph, PHP go-to-definition, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 4 is complete. The Scala fixture now covers package wildcard imports, same-package relative wildcard extension imports, direct-member precedence over extensions, receiver mismatch, conflicting inherited trait-member ambiguity, trait default inheritance, unrelated same-name methods, references, implementation, and type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes.

Milestone 4 Brokk Guided Review outcome: devops found no issues. Security/correctness and architecture found that the first wildcard-import definition helper returned definitions for ambiguous wildcard imports; senior-dev found that it also ran before enclosing-member lookup; duplication found import-candidate construction drift. Accepted fixes moved wildcard direct-member lookup behind higher-precedence scopes, return no definition when multiple wildcard imports contribute matches, reuse a shared Scala graph import-candidate helper, and add LSP click cases for local precedence and ambiguous package wildcard imports. Focused Scala LSP, Scala get-definition, Scala graph, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 5 is complete. The Java fixture now covers interface and implementation methods, inherited overrides, constructor/class construction, nested types, wildcard import positive and ambiguous-null cases, references, implementation lookup, and type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes.

Milestone 5 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security/correctness, duplication, and devops found no issues. Architecture found that the interface method references case was too weak because it did not cover override declarations or concrete receiver calls. Senior-dev found that the wildcard ambiguity case needed a positive wildcard-import control and that inherited override relations were structurally present but not exercised. Accepted fixes strengthened the fixture, added Java graph regression coverage, and fixed Java usage graph method-family matching for hierarchy-related owners. Focused Java LSP, Java graph, Java definition, Java import/hierarchy, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 6 is complete. The C# fixture now covers partial class properties, object initializer labels, self and typed receiver property references, interface implementations, inherited overrides, unrelated same-name methods, type definition for partial declarations, implementation lookup for interface and inherited base methods, and type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes.

Milestone 6 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security/correctness, security, and devops found no blocking issues. Senior-dev and duplication found that same-owner fallback was too broad for named argument labels, inherited override implementation coverage was missing, object-initializer syntax logic was duplicated, and test helper JSON was manually formatted. Architecture found that object initializer definition should not resolve through ambiguous visible type candidates. Accepted fixes add syntax-guarded same-owner lookup, exact-1 owner handling for initializer labels, shared object-initializer label detection with the C# graph scanner, a negative named-argument regression, a negative ambiguous-initializer regression, structured JSON test payloads, and an inherited override implementation LSP click. The suggestion to make C# interface-method references include concrete implementation calls was not adopted for the reason recorded in the Decision Log. Focused C# LSP, C# definition regressions, C# get-definition, object-initializer graph, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 7 is complete. The C++ fixture now covers typed value and pointer receiver method definitions, base/derived field shadowing, unrelated same-name method and field owners, bare member field lookup inside an out-of-line method body, out-of-line free function definitions, free-function references, out-of-line base/derived method references, and local shadow expected-empty behavior.

Milestone 7 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security, duplication, devops, and architecture found no blocking issues. Senior-dev found that references coverage was too narrow because only the free-function relation was asserted. Accepted fixes add exact references coverage for both derived and base out-of-line methods, including typed value and pointer receiver call sites. C++ field declaration references currently return empty on this LSP path, so field coverage stays focused on precise definition and shadowing behavior in this milestone. Focused C++ LSP, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 8 is complete. The JavaScript fixture now covers class `this` fields, constructed receivers, class-instance factory receivers, object-literal factory receivers, object-literal methods, CommonJS destructured imports, unrelated same-name object members, references, hover, and unsupported type-definition behavior.

Milestone 8 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security, duplication, devops, and architecture found no blocking issues. Senior-dev coverage review found that factory-returned objects should be covered with an object-literal factory, not only a factory returning a class instance. Accepting that feedback exposed the JavaScript get-definition gap recorded above; the fix reuses structured imports, CodeUnits, and materialized returned-object surfaces. Focused JavaScript LSP, focused JavaScript get-definition, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 9 is complete. The TypeScript fixture now covers interface and implementation methods, type aliases, static class members, typed receivers, contextual object members, contextual callback parameter definition, unrelated same-name methods, references, implementation lookup, type definition, and type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes.

Milestone 9 Brokk Guided Review outcome: architecture found no design blockers, and the accepted coverage finding was that references should exercise TypeScript type-alias members rather than only the interface method. The fixture now asserts exact references for `Payload.value` across typed method bodies, a contextual object literal key, and a typed local read. Static-member references return `null` through the current LSP surface, so that unsupported relation is not locked in as a failing milestone assertion. Focused TypeScript LSP, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 10 is complete. The Python fixture now covers reexported class aliases, classmethod factory receivers with explicit return annotations, inherited methods, decorated properties, self attribute reads, unrelated same-name methods, references, hover, type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes, and an unsupported untyped-receiver null case.

Milestone 10 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security, duplication, devops, and architecture found no blocking issues in the test-only milestone diff. Senior-dev coverage review found that the classmethod factory call should be covered by references, not only definition. Accepted fixes add exact `User.guest` references through the reexported `Account.guest()` call. Focused Python LSP, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 11 is complete. The Ruby fixture now covers namespaced constants, project-local `require_relative`, class factory receivers, mixin methods, inherited methods, module functions, unrelated same-name methods, references, type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes, and an unsupported unknown-receiver null case.

Milestone 11 Brokk Guided Review outcome: the test-only milestone diff had no blocking security, duplication, senior-dev, devops, or architecture findings after inherited-method references were included. The fixture stays within existing Ruby contracts for namespaced factory receiver inference and hierarchy ranges. Focused Ruby LSP, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Milestone 12 is complete. The final sweep adds ignored stress fixtures for Go embedded promotion and Rust trait implementation fan-out, plus a strict required-plus-optional location expectation used by the TypeScript `Payload.value` references case.

Milestone 12 Brokk Guided Review outcome: security, duplication, architecture, and devops found no blocking issues. Senior-dev found that a simple subset location helper could hide unrelated false-positive references, that the Rust stress fixture only checked the first generated receiver call, and that final validation still needed the implementation/type-hierarchy LSP filters plus clippy. Accepted fixes replace the subset helper with required-plus-optional exactness, add a tail generated Rust receiver definition case, rerun normal and ignored stress suites, and run the final validation commands. `cargo clippy-no-cuda` initially failed because Homebrew `clippy-driver` was ahead of the rustup toolchain in `PATH`; rerunning with the rustup 1.96.0 toolchain bin first passed.

## Context and Orientation

LSP means Language Server Protocol, the editor protocol used for requests such as `textDocument/definition` and `textDocument/references`. Bifrost serves LSP over stdio from the `bifrost --lsp` process, and integration tests drive that process with `tests/common/lsp_client.rs::LspServer`.

A click fixture is a small in-test project containing source markers. Inline markers such as `<call_run>` are stripped before the file is written, and the marker's position becomes the LSP click position. Caret comments such as `// ^call_run` are also supported for later milestones when placing inline markers would make the source harder to read. Each test case names a marker, an LSP operation, and an expected response shape.

Response locations are compared by file URI plus LSP range start line and character. The expected locations are also markers, so tests do not need brittle raw line and column literals.

## Plan of Work

Milestone 0 adds `tests/common/lsp_click.rs`, exports it from `tests/common/mod.rs`, and creates `tests/lsp_click_around_regression.rs` with a Java smoke fixture. The smoke fixture must prove that the harness can run a successful definition lookup, a successful references lookup, and an expected-empty definition lookup.

Milestones 1 through 11 add one language fixture per milestone in `tests/lsp_click_around_regression.rs`. Each milestone should keep the fixture realistic but small, cover at least one positive and one negative or ambiguity case, and update this plan before review and commit.

Milestone 12 adds ignored stress fixtures for at least Go embedded promotion and Rust trait implementations, then runs the final validation sweep.

After each milestone, run focused tests, run Brokk Guided Review in uncommitted-changes mode, fix accepted findings, rerun focused tests, update this plan including timings, stage only files touched by the milestone, and commit directly on the current branch.

## Concrete Steps

Run commands from the repository root:

    cd /Users/dave/.codex/worktrees/bc63/bifrost

Milestone 0 focused validation:

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test lsp_click_around_regression milestone_0 --features nlp

Milestone language validation:

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test lsp_click_around_regression <language_filter> --features nlp

Final validation:

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test lsp_click_around_regression --features nlp
    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test bifrost_lsp_server implementation --features nlp
    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test bifrost_lsp_server type_hierarchy --features nlp
    cargo fmt
    cargo clippy-no-cuda
    git diff --check

Ignored stress validation:

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test lsp_click_around_regression --features nlp -- --ignored stress

## Validation and Acceptance

The shared harness is accepted when the Milestone 0 smoke test passes and its failure messages include fixture name, case name, marker, operation, elapsed milliseconds, and the raw response when an assertion fails.

Each language milestone is accepted when the new language filter passes before review, Brokk Guided Review has been run on the milestone diff, accepted findings have been fixed, the focused tests pass again, timings are recorded here, and a milestone commit has been created.

Normal tests must be deterministic. Do not fail because a request is slow. Timing belongs in diagnostics and this plan's `Timing Log`.

## Idempotence and Recovery

The fixtures use temporary directories and can be rerun safely. If a language fixture exposes a real analyzer failure, update `Surprises & Discoveries` with the evidence, fix forward in structured analyzer code, and keep the failing fixture as the regression. If Brokk Guided Review cannot run, record the blocker and stop before committing that milestone.

Do not use `git add -A`. Stage only files changed in the current milestone. Do not push or open a pull request unless explicitly asked.

## Artifacts and Notes

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Created the plan and started Milestone 0 with a shared LSP click fixture helper. The initial helper supports inline markers, caret comment markers, location-bearing LSP response normalization, expected-empty assertions, hover substring assertions, hierarchy relation requests, and per-click elapsed time capture.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Milestone 0 pre-review implementation and focused validation are complete. The smoke fixture passed definition, references, and expected-empty definition assertions. Brokk Guided Review is the next gate before any commit.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 0 Guided Review gate. Accepted findings were fixed with path validation, safer marker parsing, UTF-16 columns, exact location assertions, non-panicking hierarchy prepare handling, and parser regression tests. `cargo fmt --check`, `git diff --check`, and focused Milestone 0 tests pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 1 and added the Go embedded-promotion click-around fixture. The pre-review focused Go filter passed, covering imported factory receiver typing, promoted field and method definition, deeper promoted field lookup, explicit field shadowing, same-depth ambiguity returning empty, and declaration-to-reference lookup for the canonical embedded field.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 1 Guided Review gate. Accepted review findings expanded the Go fixture to cover shallower-vs-deeper promotion and exact `Base.ID` references. That exposed a structured Go graph bug where qualified receiver inference matched any imported package member by qualifier alone. The fix carries namespace-to-compatible-receiver-name bindings, and focused Go LSP and graph tests now pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 2 and added the Rust trait/impl click-around fixture. The pre-review focused Rust filter passes, covering typed trait-method calls resolving to concrete impl methods, explicit trait-path UFCS resolving to the trait method, default trait method and associated-type unsupported definition boundaries, unrelated inherent same-name method definition, trait method references, implementation lookup, type definition from a type annotation, and type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 2 Guided Review gate. Accepted review findings strengthened default trait method and associated-type expectations instead of allowing expected-empty placeholders. The resulting resolver fixes use structured Rust trait/type-scope data: typed receiver calls can fall through to visible default trait methods, and `Self::Output` in a trait method resolves through the enclosing trait scope. Focused Rust LSP, Rust go-to-definition, Rust type-hierarchy, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 3 and added the PHP interface/trait click-around fixture. The pre-review focused PHP filter passes, covering interface-typed and concrete typed receiver definitions, factory-returned receiver definition, trait methods imported by class `use`, unrelated same-name methods, interface and trait method references, and implementation lookup for interface methods and types.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 3 Guided Review gate. Accepted review findings expanded interface-method references to include the interface-typed call and factory-returned call. The resulting PHP fixes use structured tree-sitter call nodes plus existing PHP type/function resolution and callable return-type helpers; no regex or text fallback was added. Focused PHP LSP, PHP graph, PHP go-to-definition, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 5 and added the Java interface/implementation/hierarchy click-around fixture. The pre-review focused Java filter passes, covering interface and concrete receiver definitions, inherited base methods, unrelated same-name methods, explicit constructor definitions, nested type definitions, ambiguous wildcard imports returning empty, interface references, implementation lookup, and type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 5 Guided Review gate. Accepted review findings expanded Java wildcard coverage with a positive single-wildcard type case, strengthened interface method references to include override declarations and concrete receiver calls, and added inherited override implementation coverage. The resulting Java graph fix uses structured type hierarchy family owners and receiver facts; no source-text fallback was added. Focused Java LSP, Java graph, Java go-to-definition, Java import/hierarchy, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 6 and added the C# partial/interface click-around fixture. The pre-review focused C# filter passes, covering partial class properties, object initializer labels, self and typed receiver property references, interface implementations, inherited overrides, unrelated same-name members, type definition for partial types, implementation lookup, and type hierarchy supertypes/subtypes.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 6 Guided Review gate. Accepted review findings narrowed same-owner C# definition lookup to reference-like identifiers, made object initializer labels require one unambiguous visible owner, shared initializer-label syntax detection with the C# graph scanner, added named-argument and ambiguous-initializer regressions, and added inherited override implementation coverage. Focused C# LSP, C# definition, C# get-definition, object-initializer graph, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 7 and added the C++ typed receiver/out-of-line fixture. The pre-review focused C++ filter passes, covering typed value and pointer receiver method definitions, field definitions with base/derived shadowing, unrelated same-name method and field owners, bare member field lookup inside an out-of-line method body, out-of-line free function definitions, free-function references, and local shadow expected-empty behavior.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 7 Guided Review gate. Accepted review feedback strengthened references coverage for out-of-line C++ base and derived methods, including typed receiver call sites. The final fixture uses separate markers for C++ references ranges at qualified out-of-line definitions, while definition lookups continue to assert method-name ranges. Focused C++ LSP, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 8 and added the JavaScript CommonJS/object fixture. The initial fixture covers class `this` fields, constructed and factory-returned receivers, object-literal methods, CommonJS destructured imports, unrelated same-name object members, hover, and unsupported type-definition behavior.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 8 Guided Review gate. Accepted review feedback strengthened factory-returned object coverage from a class-instance factory to an object-literal factory, exposing and fixing a JavaScript get-definition gap for locals initialized by call expressions whose callees have materialized returned-object surfaces. Focused JavaScript LSP, JavaScript get-definition, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 9 and added the TypeScript interface/type-alias fixture. The pre-review focused TypeScript filter passes, covering interface and implementation methods, type aliases, static class members, typed receivers, contextual object members, contextual callback parameters, unrelated same-name members, references, implementation lookup, type definition, and type hierarchy.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 9 Guided Review gate. Accepted review feedback strengthened references coverage for the `Payload.value` type-alias member across typed method bodies, contextual object keys, and typed local reads. Focused TypeScript LSP, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 10 and added the Python alias/property fixture. The pre-review focused Python filter passes, covering reexported class aliases, classmethod factory receivers with explicit return annotations, inherited methods, decorated properties, self attribute reads, unrelated same-name methods, references, hover, type hierarchy, and an unsupported untyped-receiver null case.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 10 Guided Review gate. Accepted review feedback strengthened classmethod factory references so `User.guest` now asserts the reexported `Account.guest()` call in addition to definition behavior. Focused Python LSP, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 11 and added the Ruby constants/mixins fixture. The pre-review focused Ruby filter passes, covering namespaced constants, project-local `require_relative`, class factory receivers, mixin methods, inherited methods, module functions, unrelated same-name methods, references, type hierarchy, and an unsupported unknown-receiver null case.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 11 Guided Review gate. No accepted code changes were needed after inherited-method references were included in the pre-review fixture. Focused Ruby LSP, formatting, and diff checks pass.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Started Milestone 12 and added ignored stress fixtures for Go embedded promotion and Rust trait implementations. The ignored stress filter and the normal click-around suite pass before review; final LSP implementation/type-hierarchy sweeps are still pending the review gate.

Revision note, 2026-07-07 / Codex: Completed the Milestone 12 Guided Review gate and final sweep. Accepted review feedback replaced the TypeScript subset location assertion with a stricter required-plus-optional helper, added tail generated Rust receiver definition coverage, and completed normal, ignored stress, implementation, type hierarchy, formatting, diff, and clippy-no-cuda validation. The clippy run required putting the rustup 1.96.0 toolchain bin ahead of Homebrew in PATH so cargo-clippy and clippy-driver matched rustc.
