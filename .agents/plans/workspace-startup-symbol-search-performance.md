# Make warm workspace startup and symbol search fast

This ExecPlan is a living document. Keep `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` current while work proceeds.

Maintain this document as required by `.agents/PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

A warm Bifrost workspace must become usable almost immediately. A normal symbol search must complete in less than one second. Today, a warm Apache Camel workspace takes 9.73 seconds to become ready in a debug build. Its first no-match `search_symbols` call takes 24.04 seconds. Bifrost needlessly reads and hashes clean tracked files during setup. It also reads every declaration for a language from a shared SQLite cache during each symbol search.

After this work, Bifrost will use Git index object IDs for clean tracked files. It will hash only dirty and untracked files. It will keep one exact active-tree mapping for each live workspace. Symbol search will use that mapping and storage-side literal filtering before it creates Rust rows. Broad regular-expression searches will scan only the active workspace.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: Warm setup still reads and hashes every analyzable tracked file.
  Evidence: `TreeSitterAnalyzer::resolve_live_oids` calls `file.exists()` and `Liveness::oid_for_path`. The latter canonicalizes, checks, reads, and hashes the file.

- Observation: The service option that trusts a filesystem generation does not prevent startup hashing.
  Evidence: `build_persisted_for_service` changes `LivePathMap` validation only. `resolve_live_oids` still uses the point-resolution path.

- Observation: Workspace file discovery occurs more than once.
  Evidence: `FilesystemProject::with_cached_listing` calls `FilesystemProject::new`, which calls `detect_languages`. That function performs its own complete workspace collection before the cached listing serves analyzer enumeration.

- Observation: A no-match search reads the complete shared declaration corpus for each active language.
  Evidence: `search_candidate_name_rows_for_langs` filters `code_units` by language and completeness only. It returns text OIDs and names to Rust before active-tree and pattern filtering.

- Observation: The shared CodeScale database has 1,234,140 Java declarations. Apache Camel uses 331,439 declarations from its tracked blob object IDs.
  Evidence: Direct read-only SQLite counts and a temporary join against `git ls-files -s` produced these values.

- Observation: Debug Apache Camel timings are 9.73 seconds for setup and 24.04 seconds for a no-match search.
  Evidence: `BIFROST_TIMING=1` reported 5.38 seconds for `WorkspaceAnalyzer::build`, 4.35 seconds for semantic-pack activation, and 24.029 seconds for `search_symbols.resolve`.

- Observation: The core Git plumbing already had the required dependencies but its bulk APIs still called the hashing point path.
  Evidence: `working_tree_oids` iterated through `resolve_path_oid`, and `resolve_index_entry_oid` always called `Oid::hash_file`.

- Observation: Warm Java reconciliation performed full correlated side-table integrity counts for every file.
  Evidence: The Apache Camel `missing_parsed_blob_keys_at_generations` stage took 6.50 seconds before the startup query used atomic publication markers and an active-first temporary key table.

- Observation: An empty semantic-model selection still traversed the analyzer to build an empty overlay.
  Evidence: Empty overlay acquisition fell from 725.5 milliseconds to about 40-84 milliseconds after the empty-set fast path.

- Observation: The service can trust Bifrost's transactional publication marker, but diagnostic builds must detect cache corruption.
  Evidence: The strict corruption test deleted one `code_units` row. Marker-only validation missed it. Full validation repaired it.

- Observation: The repository test gate has one resolver failure outside the changed warm-start and symbol-search paths.
  Evidence: Both normal and `nlp,python` suites fail only `an_unindexed_declared_dependency_is_a_boundary_row_rather_than_an_empty_answer`. The test uses an in-memory analyzer and does not call `search_symbols`.

- Observation: The schema-15 merge added only declaration-materialization provenance for RQL. The existing semantic and analyzer rows remain valid.
  Evidence: Migration 0015 creates only `materialization_records`. We renamed the shared version-14 database and its sidecars, applied this additive migration, and set `user_version` to 15.

- Observation: Parallel projection removes the long mutex hold and makes the shared Git identity map available to all language workers.
  Evidence: A release Apache Camel run resolved 37,451 clean tracked identities with zero file hashes. The shared Git scan and small-language projections completed in 673-702 milliseconds. The Java projection completed in 1.38 seconds while the other language workers used the same Rayon pool.

- Observation: Semantic readiness still probes source identities in path order against a blob-first primary key.
  Evidence: A 19,280-file Django prewarm spent minutes in SQLite B-tree lookup. CPU profiles showed `sqlite3BtreeIndexMoveto`, page-cache fetches, and SQLite VM work. `semantic_files` uses `(blob_oid, rel_path)` as its primary key.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Correct the identity design instead of adding eager router startup.
  Rationale: Eager startup hides latency but does not remove repeated file hashing or whole-cache scans. It also increases startup contention.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex

- Decision: Treat a Git index entry as the content identity for a clean tracked path.
  Rationale: Git already stores the exact blob object ID. Reading the file again cannot improve this identity. Dirty and untracked paths still require working-tree hashing.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex

- Decision: Keep exact path identities in each analyzer's `LiveSnapshot`. Publish its distinct blob IDs to a connection-local SQLite temporary table for candidate reads.
  Rationale: Immutable analysis remains shared. Each workspace owns its snapshot and reader pool, so concurrent workspaces cannot replace each other's active set. Path expansion still uses the exact snapshot. This design needs no persistent schema change or cache rebuild.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex

- Decision: Keep complete regular-expression semantics.
  Rationale: Storage filtering can use a mandatory literal when one exists. A pattern without one must still scan the active workspace, not the global cache.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex

- Decision: Use atomic publication validation only for service startup. Keep full side-table integrity validation for strict persisted builds.
  Rationale: Bifrost publishes one blob transactionally, so the service marker is sufficient during normal operation. Strict builds and tests must still find external database corruption.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex

- Decision: Keep the repository OID map immutable behind `Arc` after its first construction. Run language projection with Rayon after releasing the initialization lock.
  Rationale: The current mutex covers every path conversion and lookup. It serializes language threads and leaves the large Java projection on one core.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex

- Decision: Sort and deduplicate semantic file identities before batched membership queries.
  Rationale: This follows the persistent primary-key order and changes random B-tree probes into an ordered walk. The caller still receives missing identities in its original order.
  Date/Author: 2026-08-05 / Codex

## Outcomes & Retrospective

The implementation now resolves clean tracked paths from the Git index, shares one repository identity map across language analyzers, reuses one workspace listing, and limits symbol SQL to active blobs. The active set uses a connection-local `STRICT` temporary table. Literal queries filter names and qualified names in SQLite before Rust hydration.

On Apache Camel, debug analyzer construction fell from 9.73 seconds to about 4.0 seconds. The debug no-match literal `search_symbols.resolve` stage fell from 24.03 seconds to about 1.03 seconds.

The final release run constructed the analyzer in 2.86 seconds. A warm no-match symbol call took 576 milliseconds. Its resolve stage took 573.7 milliseconds. No clean tracked file was hashed; Git supplied all 37,451 identities.

The follow-up change now releases the startup mutex after the one-time Git scan. It projects each language's paths through the immutable OID map with Rayon. Concurrent nested-workspace tests prove that the shared map retains repository-relative Git paths.

After the schema-15 merge, the shared CodeScale cache was moved from the version-14 name to the version-15 name. Migration 0015 was applied directly because Bifrost's normal migration validation scans the complete 28 GiB cache. The new table is empty and optional unless RQL materialization provenance is used.

The shared cache had a cold operating-system page-cache effect during one earlier run. Its first Java symbol query took 9.63 seconds. The next Java query took 276.3 milliseconds. This is storage warmth, not repeated Bifrost indexing.

The semantic follow-up sorts and deduplicates `(blob_oid, rel_path)` membership probes before SQLite execution. The same Django prewarm that exceeded five minutes completed in 10.8 seconds. Semantic membership took 3.2 milliseconds. Its remaining 5.08 seconds built the active in-memory index. A fresh Kafka run completed in 30.3 seconds. It used 15.92 seconds to build the active index and 9.87 seconds to fill 5,474 missing Java analyzer blobs.

Formatting, all 12 focused liveness tests, and all-features clippy pass. The workspace suite reaches the same unrelated cross-language resolver failure described above after 397 other cross-language tests pass. The required policy tool is not installed.

## Context and Orientation

The Bifrost repository is `/mnt/optane/bifrost-nlp`. `crates/bifrost-core/src/analyzer/project.rs` discovers workspace files. `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/store/liveness.rs` maps workspace paths to Git blob object IDs. `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/tree_sitter_analyzer.rs` reconciles those identities with cached parsed blobs. `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/store/mod.rs` owns the SQLite schema and queries. `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/searchtools/navigation.rs` implements `search_symbols`.

A blob object ID is Git's content hash for one file. An active-tree identity states that one relative path in one live workspace currently has one blob object ID. Immutable analyzer records remain keyed by blob object ID and language. Active-tree records select which immutable records belong to one workspace.

The existing semantic cache has a suitable Git identity method in `crates/bifrost-nlp/src/gitcache.rs`: it obtains clean tracked identities from the index and hashes dirty or untracked paths. The analyzer layer cannot depend on the NLP crate. Move or reproduce the general identity operation in the analysis or core layer without adding an NLP dependency to `brokk-bifrost-analysis`.

## Plan of Work

First, add timing scopes and work counts around project collection, live identity resolution, missing-blob lookup, cached-state hydration, path-symbol synchronization, semantic-pack catalog setup, semantic-pack resolution, and symbol candidate storage reads. Keep instrumentation behind `BIFROST_TIMING`.

Second, replace `Liveness::oid_for_path` startup use with a bulk snapshot. Read the Git index once. Obtain dirty and untracked paths once with a Git index-to-worktree diff. Use index object IDs for clean tracked paths. Hash only dirty, untracked, or overlay paths. Preserve staged-file behavior: use working bytes when unstaged changes differ from the index. Add behavior tests for clean, dirty, staged, untracked, deleted, renamed, and linked-worktree cases.

Third, make `FilesystemProject::with_cached_listing` fill or read its supplied `WorkspaceFileListingCache` before language detection. Detect languages from that listing. Let analyzer enumeration filter a shared `Arc` listing without cloning the complete ordered set for every language. Preserve ignore behavior and the Git-index union.

Fourth, profile semantic-pack activation with the new scopes. Do not activate an empty overlay through expensive analyzer work. Cache immutable embedded catalog bootstrap data process-wide when safe. Keep workspace model discovery workspace-specific.

Fifth, keep exact active paths in the analyzer snapshot. Load its distinct blob IDs into a `STRICT`, connection-local SQLite temporary table. Keep this table separate for each workspace reader pool. Join immutable code-unit data through it. Do not change or duplicate the persistent cache schema.

Sixth, change symbol candidate queries. Join `code_units` to the selected active-workspace identities before returning rows. For pattern batches with a mandatory literal, apply a storage predicate to `short_name`, `identifier`, persisted qualified names, and the content qualifier. Hydrate full candidate data only for matched keys. For patterns without a mandatory literal, enumerate the compact active name projection only. Preserve cancellation and complete-result reporting.

Finally, run correctness and timing validation. Compare result sets before and after the change on focused fixtures. Start one rmcp server with two workspaces that use one database. Run concurrent searches and refreshes. Confirm that each result stays in its selected workspace. Measure Apache Camel after a fully warm prebuild.

## Concrete Steps

Work from `/mnt/optane/bifrost-nlp`. Use `apply_patch` for edits. Do not create build targets in `/tmp`. Use normal Cargo targets when possible. Use `scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh` only when isolation is necessary.

Run focused tests after each milestone. Use the shared inline-project harness for new small analyzer tests. Put new integration test modules under an existing `tests/<suite>/` directory and add them to that suite's `main.rs`.

For the final warm measurement, set `BIFROST_TIMING=1`, disable semantic indexing, use the existing CodeScale cache, and query Apache Camel. Do not trigger model embedding or a cold repository prewarm.

## Validation and Acceptance

A clean tracked workspace startup must report zero working-file content hashes. Dirty and untracked fixtures must report exactly the paths that require hashing. A staged-content fixture must analyze the correct visible bytes.

Two concurrent named workspaces that share a database must retain separate active snapshots and temporary reader tables. A refresh in one must not change the other workspace's symbol results.

Exact, qualified, substring, multi-pattern, and regular-expression symbol searches must return the same results as the reference implementation. A no-match literal query must not enumerate the global language corpus.

On the warm Apache Camel corpus, setup should approach one second and a normal no-match literal search should complete below one second. Record exact debug and release timings. If a remaining stage exceeds one second, profile and correct it before completion.

Run focused test binaries during development. Before completion, run:

    cargo fmt
    cargo test --workspace
    uv run --python 3.12 -- cargo test --features nlp,python
    cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

Check disk space before the NLP build. Do not run another NLP build when a sibling worktree already runs one.

The repository instructions require one `bifrost.code-smells` policy run plus each executable repository policy root. Run it only if the `bifrost-policy-checking` skill and its `run_policy` tool are installed. Report that validation as unavailable when the tool is not installed.

## Idempotence and Recovery

This implementation does not change the persistent schema. Temporary active tables exist only for one SQLite connection. A failed request clears or replaces its table on the next synchronization.

Warm measurements are read-mostly but can publish active generations. They are safe to repeat. Remove temporary profile files after extracting results.

## Artifacts and Notes

The baseline debug timing is:

    workspace binding                              0.3 ms
    WorkspaceAnalyzer::build                    5377.7 ms
    configured semantic-pack activation         4354.9 ms
    complete analyzer construction              9732.6 ms
    search_symbols.resolve                     24029.0 ms
    remaining search work                          6.5 ms

The flat CPU profile showed SQLite B-tree traversal, SQLite VM work, memory comparison, Git OID text parsing, path hashing, and allocation. GPU work did not appear. Semantic indexing was disabled.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

Expose one bulk Git identity operation in a layer available to `brokk-bifrost-analysis`. It must return exact relative paths, blob object IDs, and whether each identity came from the Git index or working bytes. It must not add `hf-hub`, `tokenizers`, or `fastrq` to analysis or core.

Extend `AnalyzerStore` with connection-local active candidate queries. Keep SQLite access inside the store. Callers must not construct SQL fragments from model input.

Extend `SearchSymbolPatternBatch` with safe mandatory-literal information derived from the compiled pattern. An absent literal means no storage literal filter. It must never remove a valid regular-expression match.

Revision note: 2026-08-05. Recorded the completed bulk Git identity milestone and its focused validation.

Revision note: 2026-08-05. Recorded the temporary-table design, reconciliation fix, semantic-overlay fast path, and warm debug measurements.

Revision note: 2026-08-05. Recorded final release measurements, validation results, and the strict-versus-service cache-validation boundary.

Revision note: 2026-08-05. Extended the plan for the approved parallel live-identity projection and direct `origin/master` publication.

Revision note: 2026-08-05. CI repair after publication. The published projection had four regressions. First, overlay hashing became serial inside `resolve_live_oids`; the concurrency tests failed. Second, incremental updates read the memoized startup map and served stale identities; explicit `update_paths` did not see edits. Third, the bulk scan hashed every dirty worktree file, so one unreadable file outside the analyzer file set (a locked live database under `.bifrost/cache` on Windows) failed the whole projection and forced full reparses. Fourth, the memoized map ignored edits after the scan, so `refresh` sweeps served stale identities. The repair: overlay files hash in parallel again; incremental updates use point resolution; the shared scan (`gitblob::working_tree_identity`) records index stat data and reads no file contents; serving a clean index OID re-checks the file's current size and mtime against the index entry, and only requested dirty files are hashed.
