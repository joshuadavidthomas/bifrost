# Unify usage-graph symbol resolution on the analyzer's keyed index

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds. This document must be maintained in accordance with `.agent/PLANS.md` at the repository root.

This plan builds on and supersedes the remaining work of `.agents/plans/shared-usage-index-refactor.md` (checked in; read it for the Scala-specific history). That plan added `src/analyzer/usages/symbol_index.rs` and migrated Scala onto it. This plan dissolves that module into the analyzer-owned index layer, generalizes the pattern to the other languages that need it, and removes the remaining linear declaration scans across the usage-graph code.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Bifrost's `usage_graph` and `scan_usages` tools resolve names in source files to declared symbols. Today each of the eleven supported languages resolves names its own way, and four of them (C#, Go, Python, C++) do it partly by linearly scanning every declaration in the workspace — per reference site, per hit, or per query. On large repositories this is the same O(all-declarations) pathology that was just fixed for Scala (commit a18d726). After this plan, there is exactly one workspace-wide keyed symbol index, owned and cached by the analyzer; one small derived index for callable facts (return types, arity); and one shared per-file "visible name" resolver algorithm that package/namespace-addressed languages instantiate instead of hand-rolling their own. The linear scans are gone, and the per-language code that remains is genuinely language-specific semantics (C++ overload matching, Go struct-embedding promotion, Scala extension methods, Rust trait resolution).

Observable outcomes: all existing usage-graph and get-definition test suites keep passing; new regression tests demonstrate keyed lookups where scans used to be; `src/analyzer/usages/symbol_index.rs` and `src/analyzer/usages/receiver_facts.rs` no longer exist; and grepping the usage-graph code for `get_all_declarations()` finds no resolution-path callers.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-07-07) ExecPlan drafted from a four-agent survey of all eleven language graph builders.
- [x] (2026-07-07 09:11 CDT) Milestone 1 complete: `DefinitionLookupIndex` now uses adapter-supplied normalization and simple-type naming, stores normalized FQN/type/member keyed maps, and `src/analyzer/usages/receiver_facts.rs` plus its module declaration are deleted.
- [x] (2026-07-07 09:11 CDT) Milestone 2 complete: `UsageFactsIndex` is built from analyzer state, exposed through `IAnalyzer`, Scala `ProjectTypes` consumes `DefinitionLookupIndex` plus `UsageFactsIndex`, and `src/analyzer/usages/symbol_index.rs` plus its module declaration are deleted.
- [ ] Milestone 3: shared visible-name resolver driver; migrate C# (both paths) onto it and the shared indexes.
- [ ] Milestone 4: migrate the Go query path off the `graph_declarations` linear scans.
- [ ] Milestone 5: migrate Python off its linear scans.
- [ ] Milestone 6: migrate C++ (`VisibilityIndex` keyed lookups, kill the `precise_parent_of` workspace scan, dedupe `split_top_level_commas`).
- [ ] Milestone 7: replace Java's and PHP's lazy return-type caches with `UsageFactsIndex`.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: The `definitions` map in `AnalyzerState` is already keyed by `adapter.normalize_full_name(...)` (`src/analyzer/tree_sitter_analyzer.rs`, `index_state`), while `DefinitionLookupIndex::insert` hardcodes the Scala-flavored normalization `fqn.replace("$.", ".").trim_end_matches('$')` (`src/analyzer/definition_lookup_index.rs`, in `insert`). The generic index duplicates by copy-paste what the adapter hook already abstracts.
  Evidence: compare `definition_lookup_index.rs` `insert` with `tree_sitter_analyzer.rs` `LanguageAdapter::normalize_full_name` and `scala_graph/resolver.rs::scala_normalized_fq_name` — identical string transform in two places.
- Observation: C#'s inverted-edge builder independently reinvented the symbol index (`class_units` fqn map, `MethodDeclarationIndex` keyed `(owner, name, arity)`, `MethodReturnCache`) while its forward resolver in the same language does eight full linear scans over `get_all_declarations()` for the same lookup shapes.
  Evidence: `src/analyzer/usages/csharp_graph/inverted.rs` (index construction near the top of `build_csharp_edges`) vs. `csharp_graph/resolver.rs` (`receiver_type_units`, `member_declared_type_fq_name`, `method_return_type_fq_name_for_arity`, `resolve_member_type_fq_name`, `resolve_type_fq_name` fallback) and `csharp_graph/extractor.rs` (`extension_receiver_type_matches`).
- Observation: Go solved the keyed-index problem once (`GoEdgeIndex` in `go_graph/resolver.rs`) for the edge path but the query path rebuilds the same facts with repeated linear collection (`graph_declarations` and five callers), approaching O(n²) in `collect_promoted_receiver_types`.
  Evidence: doc comment above `GoEdgeIndex` in `go_graph/resolver.rs` acknowledging the mirror structure.
- Observation: Scala's existing `(package, simple)` key and `CodeUnit::identifier()` differ for companion objects. `scala_display_name(unit)` trims a trailing `$` from the last segment, while `identifier()` deliberately returns `Foo$` when the last segment ends in `$`.
  Evidence: `src/analyzer/scala/declarations.rs` creates object type short names with `format!("{raw_name}$")`; `src/analyzer/model.rs::CodeUnit::identifier` returns the `$`-suffixed member name when the last segment ends in `$`; `src/analyzer/usages/scala_graph/resolver.rs::scala_display_name` trims the trailing `$`. Milestone 1 therefore added `LanguageAdapter::simple_type_name`, with Scala overriding it to preserve `scala_display_name` behavior.
- Observation: `SignatureMetadata` does not carry structured return-type information. It stores a signature label and parameter metadata only, so return-type extraction still has to come from language signature text.
  Evidence: `src/analyzer/model.rs::SignatureMetadata` has fields `label: String` and `parameters: Vec<ParameterMetadata>` and exposes `label()`/`parameters()` only. Milestone 2 moved Scala's existing signature arity/return helpers into `src/analyzer/scala/mod.rs` and reused them through `ScalaAdapter` rather than adding new ad hoc parsers.
- Observation: After merging type and member normalized FQN lookups into `DefinitionLookupIndex::by_normalized_fqn`, Scala's `type_by_normalized_fqn` must filter to class units before direct-member import resolution.
  Evidence: the initial Milestone 2 rebase made `import app.ConsoleRenderer.{default => renderer}` seed neither a member nor a type receiver for `renderer.render`; the normalized key `app.ConsoleRenderer.default` correctly contained `app.ConsoleRenderer$.default`, but the type probe consumed the function before the member probe. Filtering `type_by_normalized_fqn` to `is_class()` restored `scala_renamed_member_import_resolves_to_member_definition` and `scala_imported_factory_return_type_uses_factory_scope`.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Merge the raw keyed lookups of `WorkspaceSymbolIndex` into `DefinitionLookupIndex` rather than keeping two workspace indexes.
  Rationale: `DefinitionLookupIndex` is already an `IAnalyzer` trait method backed by analyzer state with a working rebuild lifecycle, and it already half-duplicates the normalization logic. Two indexes with overlapping keys invite drift; the repo's design philosophy says fix the root cause.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Claude (approved by Jonathan)
- Decision: Keep callable facts (return-type FQN, arity, is_function) in a separate derived index (`UsageFactsIndex`) built lazily from the raw index, not folded into `DefinitionLookupIndex` inserts.
  Rationale: Resolving a return-type text to an FQN requires the completed type index (Scala's build does an explicit two-pass for this). Per-declaration facts can be maintained at insert time; cross-declaration derived facts cannot, without a reverse-dependency invalidation scheme that is not worth building. Lazy build inside `AnalyzerState` inherits the existing wholesale-rebuild invalidation for free.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Claude (approved by Jonathan)
- Decision: The `(package, simple)` type map stores `Vec<CodeUnit>` per key and lets callers pick, instead of baking in the current `symbol_index.rs` policy of preferring non-`$`-suffixed FQNs.
  Rationale: The `$` preference is Scala companion-object policy and does not belong in generic code; Go needs multiple candidates preserved (interface-compatible receivers). Scala's caller applies its preference at the call site.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Claude
- Decision: The shared visible-name resolver driver targets package/namespace-addressed languages (Java, C#, PHP, Scala, C++, Go, Python-partially). JS/TS and the module axis of Rust resolve through file-scoped export/import edges (`ImportBinder`/`ExportIndex`/`reexport_seeds.rs`), which is a different, already-shared layer; they are explicitly out of scope.
  Rationale: Module-graph resolution answers "which file's export does this local name bind to"; package resolution answers "which FQN does this name denote given imports and package context". Forcing one through the other is the overstraining this refactor must avoid.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Claude (approved by Jonathan)
- Decision: Rust and Ruby are out of scope for this plan.
  Rationale: Rust already resolves through analyzer-level keyed structures (`RustReferenceContext`, `DefinitionLookupIndex`) and its return-type facts need wrapper metadata (`Box`/`Arc`/`Rc`/`Option`/`Result` unwrapping) that would contort the shared struct for one consumer. Ruby's problems are structural (single 1959-line file, no inverted-edge path, per-candidate re-parsing, mixin/MRO ordering) and get their own follow-up plan.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Claude (approved by Jonathan)
- Decision: Store `definition_lookup_index` and `usage_facts_index` as `Arc` inside `AnalyzerState`, with inherent `_shared()` accessors on `TreeSitterAnalyzer` (forwarded by `ScalaAnalyzer`) returning owned handles; `ProjectTypes` holds `Arc`s instead of cloned snapshots.
  Rationale: The Milestone 2 rebase cloned both workspace indexes per `ProjectTypes::build` to satisfy the `Arc<ScalaProjectTypes>` caches — O(workspace) string-key copies per build, at every call site including `scala/hierarchy.rs`. An `Arc` handle is a refcount bump. Deliberately inherent methods, not `IAnalyzer` methods with defaults: a trait default returning an empty index would silently mask a missing forward in wrapper analyzers. Languages migrating in Milestones 3-6 add the same inherent forward when they first need ownership. This is the intentional-refcounting case the repo conventions allow: one large immutable snapshot shared across readers.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Claude (prompted by Jonathan flagging the clone cost)
- Decision: Migration order after the foundation: C# first, then Go, Python, C++, then the Java/PHP return-cache swap.
  Rationale: C# has the largest win (eight forward-path linear scans plus three reinvented indexes) and is the best generality test for the shared API. Java and PHP already resolve names correctly through analyzer-level import-aware lookups; only their lazily-memoized return-type caches are worth replacing, so they go last and smallest.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Claude
- Decision: Build `UsageFactsIndex` eagerly in `AnalyzerState::index_state` using `LanguageAdapter` hooks, rather than storing a `OnceLock` that has to be parameterized by a per-language extractor later.
  Rationale: The index depends on the completed `DefinitionLookupIndex` and language-specific signature extraction. Eager construction keeps wholesale-rebuild invalidation, avoids trait-object lifetime plumbing through `IAnalyzer::usage_facts_index`, and still exposes the same cached immutable index to callers. This supersedes the earlier preference for lazy construction while preserving the same observable cache lifecycle.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex
- Decision: Keep Scala companion-object preference in Scala hooks/call sites, not in the generic index.
  Rationale: `DefinitionLookupIndex` stores every candidate for `(package, simple)` and normalized FQN keys. Scala's `simple_type_name` hook and `ProjectTypes` candidate selection prefer non-`$` type declarations where Scala source spelling requires it; generic consumers can preserve multiple candidates for their own semantics.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex
- Decision: Let `ProjectTypes` own cloned snapshots of `DefinitionLookupIndex` and `UsageFactsIndex` instead of borrowing them.
  Rationale: existing get-definition/get-type code caches `Arc<ScalaProjectTypes>` without a lifetime parameter. Cloning the immutable analyzer-owned indexes once per resolver construction preserves compatibility and keeps hot-path lookup borrowed inside `ProjectTypes`.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-07 / Codex

## Outcomes & Retrospective

Milestones 1 and 2 are complete in the working tree, with no commits made. `DefinitionLookupIndex` is now the raw analyzer-owned index for exact FQNs, normalized FQNs, package/simple type lookup, and owner/member lookup. `UsageFactsIndex` is the derived callable-facts index and preserves overload entries while collapsing conflicting single-return lookups to ambiguity. Scala now uses those analyzer-owned indexes while keeping its extension-method side table and AST-local `factory_returns` precedence; the guard test `overloaded_factory_receiver_emits_no_partial_edge` passed in the focused suite.

Validation on 2026-07-07: `cargo fmt` completed; `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test usage_graph_scala_test --test usages_scala_graph_test --test intellij_scala_goto_definition --test metals_goto_definition --test get_definition_test --test searchtools_fuzzy_symbol_lookup --test usages_rust_graph_test --test usages_ruby_test` passed (`get_definition_test` 376, `intellij_scala_goto_definition` 2, `metals_goto_definition` 5, `searchtools_fuzzy_symbol_lookup` 21, `usage_graph_scala_test` 13, `usages_ruby_test` 40, `usages_rust_graph_test` 92, `usages_scala_graph_test` 38); `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test definition_lookup_index` ran the three new `DefinitionLookupIndex` unit tests and passed; `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test usage_facts` ran the new `UsageFactsIndex` ambiguity test and passed; `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` completed cleanly. `rg -n "symbol_index|receiver_facts" src` returns no matches.

## Context and Orientation

All paths are relative to the repository root, which is the git worktree at `/mnt/optane/bifrost-shared-usage-index` on branch `shared-usage-index-refactor`.

Bifrost analyzes source code with tree-sitter parsers. An "analyzer" is a per-language object implementing the `IAnalyzer` trait (`src/analyzer/i_analyzer.rs`). Most languages wrap a generic `TreeSitterAnalyzer<A: LanguageAdapter>` (`src/analyzer/tree_sitter_analyzer.rs`). A `LanguageAdapter` supplies language-specific hooks; the relevant one here is `normalize_full_name(&self, fq_name: &str) -> String` (default: identity; Java overrides it in `src/analyzer/java/adapter.rs`). A "CodeUnit" (`src/analyzer/model.rs`) is one declaration — a class, function, field, or module — carrying `fq_name()`, `identifier()`, `package_name()`, `signature()`, `source()` (its file), and kind predicates like `is_class()`/`is_function()`/`is_field()`.

"FQN" means fully qualified name, e.g. `example.Service.run`. "Normalized FQN" means the adapter-normalized form; for Scala that strips companion-object markers (`Foo$` becomes `Foo`, `Foo$.bar` becomes `Foo.bar`).

The analyzer builds an immutable `AnalyzerState` in `AnalyzerState::index_state(files, project, adapter)` (`src/analyzer/tree_sitter_analyzer.rs`, around line 905). State is rebuilt wholesale, never patched in place, so anything stored inside it is invalidated correctly for free. State already contains `definition_lookup_index: DefinitionLookupIndex`, exposed through `IAnalyzer::definition_lookup_index()`.

`DefinitionLookupIndex` (`src/analyzer/definition_lookup_index.rs`) is the existing workspace-wide keyed index over CodeUnits: `by_fqn`, `direct_children_by_fqn`, `by_file_identifier`, `packages`, `files_by_package`, `normalized_fqns` (a `HashSet<String>` of existence only, built with the hardcoded `$` normalization noted in Surprises).

The usage subsystem lives in `src/analyzer/usages/`. Each language has a `<lang>_graph.rs` facade plus a `<lang>_graph/` directory with (typically) `extractor.rs` (the forward per-target scan for `scan_usages`), `resolver.rs` (target classification and name resolution), `inverted.rs` (the whole-workspace edge builder for `usage_graph`), and `hits.rs`. `src/analyzer/usages/inverted_edges.rs` is the already-shared edge-collection engine; do not touch it. `src/analyzer/usages/symbol_index.rs` is the module this plan dissolves: it defines `TypeDecl`, `MemberDecl`, `WorkspaceSymbolIndexBuilder`, and `WorkspaceSymbolIndex` with keyed maps for types (by FQN, normalized FQN, `(package, simple)`) and members (by normalized FQN, by `(owner, name)`), plus `callable_return_types: HashMap<String, Option<String>>` where an ambiguous return collapses to `None`. Its only consumer is `src/analyzer/usages/scala_graph/inverted.rs` (`ProjectTypes`).

`src/analyzer/usages/receiver_facts.rs` is dead code: its only reference in the crate is the `pub(crate) mod receiver_facts;` line in `src/analyzer/usages/mod.rs`. Verified by grep on 2026-07-07.

The linear scans this plan eliminates, by language (function names are the stable anchors; line numbers drift):

C# forward path, all scanning `csharp.get_all_declarations()` (which clones a Vec of every declaration in the workspace) per reference site: `receiver_type_units` (two scans), `member_declared_type_fq_name`, `method_return_type_fq_name_for_arity`, `resolve_member_type_fq_name` (scan branch), `resolve_type_fq_name` (scan fallback) in `csharp_graph/resolver.rs`; `extension_receiver_type_matches` in `csharp_graph/extractor.rs`; plus `enclosing_declared_type` in `resolver.rs` which scans `get_declarations(file)` with manual range containment instead of using the shared `ClassRangeIndex` from `inverted_edges.rs`.

Go query path: `graph_declarations` in `go_graph/resolver.rs` collects every declaration of every candidate file into a Vec, and is called by `collect_promoted_receiver_types`, `graph_direct_member_fqns`, `graph_direct_children`, `graph_embedded_field_type_fqns`, and `graph_fqn_exists` — several of them repeatedly within one query. The keyed equivalent already exists in the same file as `GoEdgeIndex` (`package_names`, `constructor_return_types`, `direct_member_fqns`, `embedded_field_type_fqns`), used only by the edge path.

Python: `resolve_receiver_type` in `python_graph/resolver.rs` falls back to a linear `get_all_declarations().find(...)`; `target_class_method_named` in `python_graph/extractor.rs` runs a full workspace scan per candidate attribute node; `collect_imported_class_method_return_types` in `python_graph/extractor.rs` scans all declarations per imported class.

C++: every lookup on `VisibilityIndex` (`cpp_graph/resolver.rs`) — `resolve_type`, `resolve_named`, `named_candidates`, `contains_named_symbol`, `resolve_known_non_target`, `resolve_call_return_binding` — linearly filters the per-file `visible_by_file: HashMap<ProjectFile, HashSet<CodeUnit>>` bag; and `precise_parent_of` does `get_all_declarations().find(...)` per recorded hit (called from `hits.rs::enclosing_context`).

Java and PHP have no resolution-path linear scans. Java resolves through `JavaAnalyzer::resolve_type_name_in_file` (`src/analyzer/java/imports.rs::resolve_type_name`), which composes keyed lookups: exact FQN via `definitions()`, then the file's cached imports map, then a same-package probe `definitions("{package}.{name}")`, then a global fallback. PHP resolves through analyzer-level `resolve_php_type`/`resolve_php_function`/`resolve_php_constant`. What Java and PHP do hand-roll is lazy return-type memoization: Java's `MethodReturnCache`/`FileReturnCache` in `java_graph/inverted.rs` re-parse method bodies; PHP's `CallableReturnCache`/`FileReturnCache` in `php_graph/inverted.rs` plus `declared_field_type_fq_name`/`declared_callable_return_type_fq_name` in `php_graph/syntax.rs` re-parse the declaring file per lookup.

Scala's current shape after commit a18d726, which Milestone 2 rebases: `ProjectTypes` in `scala_graph/inverted.rs` builds a `WorkspaceSymbolIndexBuilder` from `scala.all_declarations()`, first types, then members (using a throwaway types-only index to resolve each member's return-type text via `return_type_fqn`, the keyed three-way probe: `(package, simple)`, exact FQN, normalized FQN). Scala keeps two things outside the shared index, and both must survive the rebase unchanged: the `extension_methods_by_name` side table (Scala-3 extension methods), and the per-file AST-local `factory_returns` map built by `collect_factory_return_types`, which takes precedence over the workspace index whenever it has an entry — even an ambiguous one — because analyzer declarations can collapse same-FQN overloads that the AST-local map still distinguishes (see the prior plan's Decision Log; the guarding test is `overloaded_factory_receiver_emits_no_partial_edge`).

Test environment for every milestone: run suites as `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test <suite>` from the repository root so no semantic-index threads or model downloads start. New tests that need small ad hoc projects must use `InlineTestProject` from `tests/common/inline_project.rs` (see `tests/usage_graph_scala_test.rs` for the style). The lint gate is `cargo fmt` then `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`; the repository denies all warnings.

## Plan of Work

### Milestone 1 — extend DefinitionLookupIndex; delete dead module

Goal: `DefinitionLookupIndex` becomes the single raw keyed index, with adapter-driven normalization instead of the hardcoded `$` transform, and gains the two key shapes `symbol_index.rs` has that it lacks.

In `src/analyzer/definition_lookup_index.rs`: change `insert` to `insert(&mut self, unit: &CodeUnit, normalize: &dyn Fn(&str) -> String)` (or an equivalent generic parameter) and use it for the normalized entries; change `from_declarations` accordingly. Replace the `normalized_fqns: HashSet<String>` existence set with `by_normalized_fqn: HashMap<String, Vec<CodeUnit>>` and keep `normalized_fqn_exists` as a thin wrapper so existing callers compile. Add `types_by_package_simple: HashMap<(String, String), Vec<CodeUnit>>` populated for `is_class()` units keyed by `(package_name, identifier)` with accessor `types_in_package(&self, package: &str, simple: &str) -> &[CodeUnit]`. Add `direct_children_by_normalized_fqn: HashMap<String, Vec<CodeUnit>>` (parent key normalized) and an accessor `members_for_owner_name(&self, owner_fqn: &str, normalized_owner_fqn: &str, name: &str) -> Vec<&CodeUnit>` that probes the exact-owner children first, then the normalized-owner children, filtering by `identifier() == name` — mirroring the exact-then-normalized fallback contract of `WorkspaceSymbolIndex::members_for_owner_name`.

In `src/analyzer/tree_sitter_analyzer.rs::index_state`, pass `|s| adapter.normalize_full_name(s)` to the insert calls. Audit all other `DefinitionLookupIndex::insert`/`from_declarations` callers (grep; there is at least the unit test in the module itself) and thread a normalizer through — identity where no adapter exists.

One subtlety to verify rather than assume: Scala's `(package, simple)` key currently uses `scala_display_name(unit)` (the last `.`-segment of `short_name()`), not `identifier()`. Check whether they differ for the units Scala indexes (companion objects, nested types). If they differ, add a `LanguageAdapter` hook `fn simple_type_name(&self, unit: &CodeUnit) -> String { unit.identifier().to_string() }` and override it for Scala; record what you found in Surprises & Discoveries.

Also in this milestone: delete `src/analyzer/usages/receiver_facts.rs` and its `mod` line in `src/analyzer/usages/mod.rs` (re-verify zero other references first).

Acceptance: full existing suites pass unchanged — at minimum `get_definition_test`, `searchtools_fuzzy_symbol_lookup`, `usages_rust_graph_test`, `usages_ruby_test`, `usage_graph_scala_test`, `usages_scala_graph_test` (Rust and Ruby consume `fqn_direct_children`/`file_identifier`; get_definition consumes the index broadly). Add unit tests in `definition_lookup_index.rs` for the new keys, including a normalization-sensitive case (a `Foo$`-style FQN resolvable through the normalized map when the normalizer strips `$`).

### Milestone 2 — derived UsageFactsIndex; rebase Scala; delete symbol_index.rs

Goal: callable facts get one home, built lazily from analyzer state; Scala consumes the merged layers; `symbol_index.rs` is gone.

Create `src/analyzer/usage_facts.rs` defining:

    pub(crate) struct CallableFacts {
        pub(crate) arity: Option<usize>,
        pub(crate) return_type_fqn: Option<String>,
        pub(crate) is_function: bool,
    }

    pub(crate) struct UsageFactsIndex {
        by_fqn: HashMap<String, Vec<CallableFactsEntry>>, // every overload declaration preserved
        unambiguous_return_by_fqn: HashMap<String, Option<String>>, // collapse rule below
    }

with accessors `callable_return_type(&self, fqn: &str) -> Option<&str>` (returns `None` when absent or ambiguous — the same collapse rule as `symbol_index.rs::insert_callable_return_type`: two declarations sharing an FQN with different return types yield `None`), `callable_return_candidates(&self, fqn: &str) -> impl Iterator<Item = &str>` (all distinct candidates, for Go's multi-candidate needs in Milestone 4), and `facts(&self, fqn: &str) -> &[CallableFactsEntry]`. Exact field/entry shapes may be adjusted for ergonomics; the accessors and collapse semantics are the contract. Preserve the prior plan's invariant that overload declarations sharing a displayed FQN are all retained (the Scala override-target builder iterates every member declaration).

Build: a free function `UsageFactsIndex::build(analyzer: &dyn IAnalyzer, extract: &dyn SignatureFactsExtractor) -> UsageFactsIndex` where `SignatureFactsExtractor` is a small trait supplying `arity_of(signature: &str) -> Option<usize>` and `return_type_text(signature: &str) -> Option<&str>`. Before writing string helpers, inspect `SignatureMetadata` in `AnalyzerState` (`signature_metadata` map in `tree_sitter_analyzer.rs`): if it already carries structured parameter/return information, source the facts from it instead of re-interpreting signature strings, and record the finding in Surprises & Discoveries. Where signature text must be interpreted, reuse the existing per-language helpers (Scala's `signature_return_type` and `member_signature_arity` in `scala_graph/inverted.rs`) rather than writing new ad hoc parsing — the repo's design rules forbid new string mini-parsers where structure exists. Return-type FQN resolution is the two-pass step: after collecting all facts with raw return-type text, resolve each text against the (already-complete) `DefinitionLookupIndex` with the keyed three-way probe Scala uses today in `return_type_fqn` — `(package, simple)`, exact FQN, then normalized FQN.

Caching: store `OnceLock<UsageFactsIndex>` (or `OnceCell`) inside `AnalyzerState` so it shares the wholesale-rebuild invalidation, exposed as `fn usage_facts_index(&self) -> &UsageFactsIndex` on `IAnalyzer` with a default empty implementation like `definition_lookup_index()`. If threading the `SignatureFactsExtractor` through the trait proves awkward, an acceptable fallback is building it eagerly in `index_state`; record whichever you choose in the Decision Log with the reasoning.

Rebase Scala: rewrite `ProjectTypes` in `scala_graph/inverted.rs` to consume `analyzer.definition_lookup_index()` (through whatever forwarding `ScalaAnalyzer` needs — check that `ScalaAnalyzer` delegates `definition_lookup_index()` to its inner `TreeSitterAnalyzer`; Java's wrapper in `src/analyzer/java/mod.rs` shows the delegation pattern) plus `UsageFactsIndex`, keeping its public method surface (`method_targets_for_owner_member`, `inherited_method_targets_for_owner_member`, `member_return_type`, `member_return_type_for_owner_member`, `package_types`, `type_by_normalized_fqn`, `member_by_normalized_fqn`) so `NameResolver` and the scan code do not change behavior. The companion-object preference (prefer the non-`$` FQN when both `Foo` and `Foo$` share a `(package, simple)` key) moves from the deleted `insert_package_type` into Scala's call sites, since the merged map now stores all candidates. `extension_methods_by_name` and the AST-local `factory_returns` precedence stay exactly as they are. Then delete `src/analyzer/usages/symbol_index.rs` and its `mod` line; port its three unit tests to the new homes (the type-lookup test against `DefinitionLookupIndex`, the member/return tests against `UsageFactsIndex`).

Acceptance: `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test usage_graph_scala_test --test usages_scala_graph_test --test intellij_scala_goto_definition --test metals_goto_definition --test get_definition_test` passes; `overloaded_factory_receiver_emits_no_partial_edge` specifically still passes; grep confirms `symbol_index` appears nowhere in `src/`; lint gate clean.

### Milestone 3 — shared visible-name resolver; migrate C#

Goal: one implementation of the probe order "exact FQN → file imports → same package → global unique", and C# resolved through keyed lookups on both paths.

Create `src/analyzer/usages/visible_names.rs` with a per-file import context trait and a resolver function, approximately:

    pub(crate) trait FileImportContext {
        fn imported_type(&self, simple: &str) -> Option<String>; // simple name -> imported FQN
        fn package_of_file(&self) -> &str;
    }

    pub(crate) fn resolve_visible_type<'a>(
        index: &'a DefinitionLookupIndex,
        ctx: &dyn FileImportContext,
        raw_name: &str,
        normalize: &dyn Fn(&str) -> String,
        visible: &dyn Fn(&CodeUnit) -> bool, // per-language visibility filter; C++ passes include-closure membership, others pass |_| true
    ) -> Option<&'a CodeUnit>;

The probe order and the "global fallback only when unique" rule are the contract (Java's `resolve_type_name` in `src/analyzer/java/imports.rs` is the reference algorithm — read it before writing this). Exact signatures may be adapted; record deviations in the Decision Log.

Migrate C#: implement `FileImportContext` for C# from the analyzer's existing using/alias data (`csharp.resolve_visible_type` and `using_aliases_of` show where that lives). Replace the eight linear scans listed in Context and Orientation with keyed lookups: type-by-FQN scans become `definition_lookup_index().fqn(...)`, owner+member scans become `members_for_owner_name(...)`, return-type-for-arity becomes `usage_facts_index()` accessors, and `enclosing_declared_type` switches to the shared `ClassRangeIndex`. In `csharp_graph/inverted.rs`, delete `class_units`, `csharp_method_declaration_index`/`MethodDeclarationIndex`, and `MethodReturnCache`, replacing them with the shared indexes so the forward and inverted paths consume the same instances. C#-specific semantics stay: extension-method receiver matching (keep its own small keyed side table if needed, mirroring Scala's `extension_methods_by_name` pattern), `nameof()` exclusion, object-initializer labels.

Acceptance: `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test usage_graph_csharp_test --test usages_csharp_graph_test --test roslyn_goto_definition` passes; grep shows no `get_all_declarations()` caller remains under `csharp_graph/`; add one regression test in `tests/usage_graph_csharp_test.rs` (InlineTestProject) that resolves a method usage through receiver return-type chaining with many unrelated declarations present, proving the keyed path handles what the scans did.

### Milestone 4 — Go query path

Goal: the query path consumes the same keyed facts as the edge path; the `graph_declarations` family is gone.

In `go_graph/resolver.rs`, replace the `graph_declarations`-based helpers (`graph_direct_member_fqns`, `graph_direct_children`, `graph_embedded_field_type_fqns`, `graph_fqn_exists`, and the collection inside `collect_promoted_receiver_types`) with lookups against `definition_lookup_index()` and `usage_facts_index()` — Go's `constructor_return_types` keeps multi-candidate semantics via `callable_return_candidates`. The cleanest shape is likely to make the query path build or share a `GoEdgeIndex` (it is already tree-free and keyed) rather than introduce a third structure; prefer whichever removes more code, and record the choice. Go-specific logic stays layered on top: struct-embedding promotion (`go_unique_indexed_member_candidate_at_nearest_depth`), structural interface satisfaction, package-directory resolution (`dir_index`).

Acceptance: `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test usage_graph_go_test --test usages_go_graph_test --test gopls_goto_definition` passes; grep confirms `graph_declarations` no longer exists.

### Milestone 5 — Python

Replace the three scan sites: `resolve_receiver_type`'s all-declarations fallback and `target_class_method_named` become keyed probes (`types_in_package`/`fqn`/`members_for_owner_name`); `collect_imported_class_method_return_types` sources member return facts from `usage_facts_index()` (Python's decorator-sensitive classification, e.g. detecting `classmethod`, stays in Python code — only the member enumeration goes through the index). Python's file-local `collect_factory_return_types_from_root` stays as-is: like Scala's `factory_returns`, it is AST-local inference, not workspace lookup.

Acceptance: `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test usages_python_test --test usages_python_graph_test --test intellij_python_find_usages --test basedpyright_goto_definition` passes; grep confirms no `get_all_declarations()` caller remains under `python_graph/`.

### Milestone 6 — C++

Rework `VisibilityIndex` in `cpp_graph/resolver.rs`: keep computing the include-closure per file, but store it as a membership set (files or units) used as the `visible` filter for `resolve_visible_type`, while the actual name lookups go through `definition_lookup_index()` keyed maps instead of filtering the `visible_by_file` bag. Kill `precise_parent_of`'s `get_all_declarations().find(...)` by resolving the parent through `fqn(...)` keyed lookup. The alias index (`using`/`typedef`), overload/argument matching (`cpp_call_match.rs`), and out-of-line member-definition handling stay C++-specific. Also in this milestone: `split_top_level_commas` exists verbatim in both `cpp_graph/resolver.rs` and `cpp_call_match.rs` (`cpp_split_top_level_commas`) — keep one, delete the other.

Acceptance: `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test usage_graph_cpp_test --test usages_cpp_graph_test --test clangd_goto_definition` passes; grep confirms no `get_all_declarations()` caller remains under `cpp_graph/`.

### Milestone 7 — Java and PHP return-fact swap

Replace Java's `MethodReturnCache`/`FileReturnCache` in `java_graph/inverted.rs` and PHP's `CallableReturnCache`/`FileReturnCache` in `php_graph/inverted.rs` (plus the per-lookup re-parsing in `php_graph/syntax.rs::declared_callable_return_type_fq_name`/`declared_field_type_fq_name`) with `usage_facts_index()` lookups. Caution for Java: the current cache infers return types by walking method bodies when the declared signature lacks resolution — verify what `SignatureMetadata`/signatures give for Java before assuming the index can answer; if body inference is genuinely needed for cases signatures cannot answer, keep that path as a fallback behind the index probe and record it. Do not touch `resolve_type_name_in_file`/`resolve_php_type` — they are already the pattern this plan generalizes.

Acceptance: `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test usage_graph_java_test --test usages_java_graph_test --test jdt_goto_definition --test usage_graph_php_test --test usages_php_graph_test --test phpactor_goto_definition` passes. Note for any new PHP cross-file test fixtures: they need a `composer.json` with a PSR-4 autoload entry (for example `{"autoload":{"psr-4":{"App\\":"src/"}}}`) or candidate-file selection silently finds nothing.

## Concrete Steps

Work from `/mnt/optane/bifrost-shared-usage-index`. After each milestone run, in order:

    cargo fmt
    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test <the milestone's suites listed above>
    cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

At the end of the full plan (or any multi-milestone session), additionally run the cross-cutting suites:

    BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=off cargo test --test usage_graph_test --test usage_graph_identity_test --test cross_language_self_usages --test usages_finder_fallback_test

Clippy must be clean; the repo denies warnings. `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` is acceptable where a function legitimately needs many parameters.

## Validation and Acceptance

The refactor is accepted when: every suite named in the milestone acceptance sections passes; `src/analyzer/usages/symbol_index.rs` and `src/analyzer/usages/receiver_facts.rs` are deleted; `grep -rn "get_all_declarations" src/analyzer/usages/` returns no callers on resolution paths in `csharp_graph/`, `python_graph/`, `cpp_graph/` (Rust's `self_like_constructor_returns` in `rust_graph/extractor.rs` is explicitly allowed to remain — out of scope); `grep -rn "graph_declarations" src/analyzer/usages/go_graph/` is empty; and the new unit tests in `definition_lookup_index.rs` and `usage_facts.rs` demonstrate keyed lookup including the normalization and ambiguity-collapse rules.

## Idempotence and Recovery

All changes are ordinary source edits in a dedicated worktree on a dedicated branch; re-running any milestone's steps is safe. Each milestone leaves the tree compiling and green, so work can stop and resume at any milestone boundary using only this document. Do not use `git add -A`; stage only files changed for this plan. Implementation runs delegated to a coding agent must NOT create commits — leave changes in the working tree for review; the reviewer stages from `git status` and commits.

## Artifacts and Notes

The keyed three-way probe that replaces linear type resolution, as it exists in Scala today (`scala_graph/inverted.rs::return_type_fqn`) and generalizes through the merged index:

    type_index
        .type_by_package_simple(package_name, base)
        .or_else(|| type_index.type_by_fqn(base))
        .or_else(|| type_index.type_by_normalized_fqn(&normalized(base)))

The ambiguity-collapse rule for callable return types (from the deleted `symbol_index.rs`, preserved in `UsageFactsIndex`): the first declaration records its return type; any later declaration with the same FQN but a different return type overwrites the entry with "ambiguous" (`None`), and lookups treat absent and ambiguous identically.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

In `src/analyzer/definition_lookup_index.rs`, at the end of Milestone 1 these accessors must exist on `DefinitionLookupIndex` (in addition to everything already there):

    pub(crate) fn types_in_package(&self, package: &str, simple: &str) -> &[CodeUnit];
    pub(crate) fn by_normalized_fqn(&self, normalized: &str) -> &[CodeUnit];
    pub(crate) fn members_for_owner_name(&self, owner_fqn: &str, normalized_owner_fqn: &str, name: &str) -> Vec<&CodeUnit>;

In `src/analyzer/usage_facts.rs`, at the end of Milestone 2:

    pub(crate) fn callable_return_type(&self, fqn: &str) -> Option<&str>;
    pub(crate) fn callable_return_candidates(&self, fqn: &str) -> impl Iterator<Item = &str>;

exposed via `IAnalyzer::usage_facts_index(&self) -> &UsageFactsIndex` with an empty default, mirroring `definition_lookup_index()`.

In `src/analyzer/usages/visible_names.rs`, at the end of Milestone 3: the `FileImportContext` trait and `resolve_visible_type` function as sketched in Milestone 3, with Java's `resolve_type_name` probe order as the behavioral contract.

Use `crate::hash::HashMap`/`HashSet` throughout (the repo's standard hasher), never `BTreeMap` unless ordering is semantically required. Prefer iterators and borrowed returns over cloning in the accessors; these run in hot loops.

Revision note 2026-07-07 / Codex: Executed only Milestones 1 and 2, updated Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes with implementation findings and validation evidence, and left Milestones 3 through 7 untouched for future work.
