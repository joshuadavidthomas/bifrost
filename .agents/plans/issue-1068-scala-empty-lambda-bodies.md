# Parse Scala empty-bodied block lambdas without truncating declarations

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds. Maintain this document in accordance with `.agents/PLANS.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

After this change, Bifrost will parse valid Scala calls such as `simulation.run() { _ => }` without turning the enclosing class body into a tree-sitter `ERROR`. In the Chisel reproduction from issue #1068, `svsimTests.VCSSpec` will span its complete body, its fields will be independently indexed, and the declarations following it in `BackendSpec.scala` will remain visible through SearchTools. A user can observe the repair by asking `get_symbol_sources` for `svsimTests.VCSSpec` at Chisel commit `e639b4f69e90ecf3f14c25b898fda9d1eadf3cc1`: the result must include lines 16 through 234 instead of only the class header on line 16.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-07-23 06:19Z) Refreshed `origin`, confirmed the issue branch is clean at `1a5a9a72`, and verified that the five newer `origin/master` commits do not touch Scala or the vendored grammar.
- [x] (2026-07-23 06:19Z) Confirmed that GitHub and crates.io still publish only `tree-sitter-scala` 0.26.0 from 2026-04-18, while the required upstream fix merged later as PR #551 / commit `88a12d30bd14edfab6d4552af22f6d3a5f5000e9`.
- [x] (2026-07-23 06:19Z) Reproduced current behavior against the exact Chisel commit: the raw parser emits an `ERROR` at bytes `410..22749`, `get_symbol_sources` returns only `class VCSSpec extends BackendSpec`, and `search_symbols` reports no fields from the file.
- [x] (2026-07-23 06:19Z) Regenerated upstream PR #551 in a temporary checkout with `tree-sitter-cli` 0.25.9 and proved that the exact Chisel file then parses with `root_has_error=false`.
- [x] (2026-07-23 07:05Z) Ported upstream PR #551 coherently, documented the third vendored patch, regenerated with CLI 0.25.9 twice with identical hashes, and added empty-lambda, self-type, enum, and extension parser controls.
- [x] (2026-07-23 07:34Z) Added a minimized Chisel-shaped fixture that fails with the published parser, plus analyzer, SearchTools, I1 property-fuzzer, and pre-#1068 persisted-cache epoch regressions.
- [x] (2026-07-23 07:42Z) Replayed Chisel `e639b4f6`: `VCSSpec` now spans lines 16–234, all three expected fields are indexed, and summaries retain the later classes and `BackendSpec`.
- [x] (2026-07-23 08:07Z) Passed focused #1068/#1016/#1073 tests, formatting, package verification, and all-feature clippy; the all-feature suite passed 1,700 tests with only three sandbox-denied process tests, all seven of whose module tests passed outside the sandbox. Reviewed the final diff with no further code findings.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: The required fix exists upstream but is not in any published crate.
  Evidence: GitHub reports `v0.26.0`, published 2026-04-18, as the latest release; crates.io reports `tree-sitter-scala = "0.26.0"`; upstream PR #551 merged on 2026-07-21.

- Observation: The Chisel failure is caused by valid empty-bodied block lambdas, not by the class header or declaration extraction.
  Evidence: The current grammar requires `$._block` after `=>` in `_block_lambda_expression`. Chisel contains `simulation.run(...) { _ => }` at lines 75, 226, and 327. Adding upstream's optional body production makes the complete 680-line file error-free.

- Observation: The empty-lambda change is coupled to self-type parsing.
  Evidence: `{ self: Base => }` is lexically ambiguous with an empty-bodied lambda. Upstream PR #551 adds explicit empty self-type-only template alternatives so dynamic precedence can select `self_type` instead of silently accepting the wrong lambda tree.

- Observation: The connected Bifrost MCP server is unavailable in this task session.
  Evidence: Tool discovery exposes no Bifrost analyzer calls in this turn. The checked-out `target/debug/bifrost` one-shot CLI remains available and reproduced the public SearchTools failure directly.

- Observation: A bare empty lambda is insufficient as a public regression witness.
  Evidence: The published 0.25.1 parser accepts a small `simulation.run() { _ => }` class. The truncation is reproduced by Chisel's nested matcher/spec/call shape; the minimized fixture retains that shape and proves the published parser ends `VCSSpec` before its sentinel method.

- Observation: The repaired parser restores the complete exact Chisel symbol surface.
  Evidence: Source-restricted one-shot tools at Chisel `e639b4f6` return `VCSSpec` at lines 16–234, fields `finishRe`, `backend`, and `compilationSettings` at lines 18, 21, and 27, and later top-level declarations beginning with `CustomVerilatorBackend` at line 239.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Keep the current v0.25.1 vendored base and port upstream PR #551 rather than waiting for a release or updating to an unreleased master snapshot.
  Rationale: No published package contains the fix. The existing vendor already carries #1016 and #1073, and a bounded upstream patch preserves that known base while providing immutable provenance.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-23 / Codex

- Decision: Port PR #551 as one coherent grammar patch, including its empty self-type and enum changes, rather than changing only `_block_lambda_expression`.
  Rationale: Making the lambda body optional by itself creates new successful but structurally wrong parses for self-type-only template bodies. The merged upstream patch resolves those ambiguities and supplies corpus controls.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-23 / Codex

- Decision: Keep the full Chisel checkout as an ephemeral validation corpus and commit a compact behavior-focused regression.
  Rationale: The repository guidance favors `InlineTestProject` for small test projects, while the exact 680-line upstream file is still valuable as an end-to-end acceptance replay without permanently duplicating an external corpus.
  Date/Author: 2026-07-23 / Codex

- Decision: Rebase the issue branch onto `origin/master` after the grammar milestone.
  Rationale: The user explicitly authorized the rebase. Committing the grammar milestone first provided a clean boundary, and the rebase completed without conflicts.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

Issue #1068 is repaired on the existing vendored v0.25.1 base by applying the complete upstream #551 grammar change alongside the existing #1016 and #1073 patches. The generated artifacts are deterministic, the parser keeps empty lambdas structured without stealing self types, the compact fixture proves the published parser still truncates while Bifrost does not, and the epoch bump invalidates stale parsed blobs.

The exact Chisel replay is restored end to end: `VCSSpec` spans lines 16–234, its three expected fields are independently indexed, and every later class remains present in summaries. Package verification reports 8,357,323 compressed bytes against a 10,000,000-byte budget. Formatting and all-feature clippy pass. The feature-enabled full suite reached 1,700 passing and 5 ignored tests; its only three failures were sandbox `Operation not permitted` results in `benchmark::mcp_session`, and the complete seven-test module passed when rerun outside the sandbox.

The private parser remains necessary because upstream 0.26.0 predates #551. Removal is intentionally deferred until a published release contains all required fixes and passes the committed coexistence controls.

## Context and Orientation

Bifrost compiles its Scala parser from `vendor/tree-sitter-scala` in `build.rs`. It deliberately private-prefixes every native parser and scanner symbol so a downstream dependency on the published `tree-sitter-scala` crate cannot substitute a different parser at link time. `vendor/tree-sitter-scala/grammar.js` is the human-readable grammar; `src/grammar.json`, `src/node-types.json`, and `src/parser.c` are generated with `tree-sitter-cli` 0.25.9 and are checked into the repository so builds require no network or JavaScript tooling.

A block lambda is a function literal passed inside braces, such as `{ value => consume(value) }`. Scala also permits an empty body, such as `{ _ => }`, which evaluates to `Unit`. The current `_block_lambda_expression` rule requires a non-empty `$._block`, so tree-sitter enters error recovery at the arrow. In a sufficiently large class, recovery consumes the class body and every following top-level declaration.

Scala self types use similar syntax inside a class, trait, or enum body, for example `trait A { self: Base => }`. Upstream PR #551 makes empty lambda bodies legal while adding explicit productions that retain such forms as `self_type`. The same patch also allows modifiers on enum cases used by its production witness. These rules must be adopted together.

`src/analyzer/store/epoch.rs` computes a per-language analysis epoch. Node and field names are automatically fingerprinted, but parser-table-only behavior can change without altering either. The Scala epoch therefore has an explicit salt naming the vendored parser patches. That salt must add #1068 so old persisted parse results are discarded.

The relevant public behavior is exercised through `SearchToolsService`. Tests should use `tests/common/inline_project.rs` rather than manually creating temporary projects. The MCP property fuzzer's I1 invariant already recognizes a class declaration immediately adjacent to a large parser `ERROR` as `declaration-truncated-at-parse-error`.

## Plan of Work

First, apply the declarative changes from upstream tree-sitter-scala PR #551 to `vendor/tree-sitter-scala/grammar.js`. Preserve the existing contextual `extension` conflict and constructor-annotation fix. Add the empty lambda body, empty braced and indented self-type bodies, enum self types, and enum-case modifiers exactly as represented by upstream merge commit `88a12d30bd14edfab6d4552af22f6d3a5f5000e9`. Update `BIFROST_PATCH.md` to identify that commit and explain that the private parser may be removed after an official release contains #1016, #1073, and #551 together. Regenerate the generated grammar files with CLI 0.25.9.

Add parser-level tests in `src/analyzer/scala/language.rs`. One test must parse an empty-bodied wildcard lambda without errors and observe a `lambda_expression`. Additional controls must prove that braced and indented self-type-only traits produce `self_type`, that the enum witness produces a self type and a private enum case, and that the existing Scala 2 `extension` identifier and Scala 3 extension definition remain valid.

Add a compact Chisel-shaped source to the existing Scala integration tests through `InlineTestProject`. It must contain an enclosing class, nested callbacks with `{ _ => }`, members after the callbacks, and a following top-level declaration. Assert that the class source includes its closing body, the post-callback members are independently indexed with the class as parent, and the following declaration remains top-level. Exercise the same fixture through `get_symbol_sources` and the property fuzzer's I1 invariant so both analyzer and public-service behavior are protected.

Before changing the Scala epoch salt, record the current pre-#1068 epoch hash. Update the salt in `src/analyzer/store/epoch.rs`, rename the existing narrowly #1073-named cache test to describe parser-table changes generally, and seed the recorded pre-#1068 epoch so the test proves that the new grammar invalidates old Scala blobs.

Finally, validate the exact Chisel checkout at commit `e639b4f69e90ecf3f14c25b898fda9d1eadf3cc1`. Run the raw parser or property fuzzer in ephemeral mode and the one-shot `get_symbol_sources`, `search_symbols`, and `get_summaries` tools against only `svsim/src/test/scala/BackendSpec.scala`. Confirm that `VCSSpec` covers lines 16 through 234, that `finishRe`, `backend`, and `compilationSettings` are indexed, and that later classes remain visible.

## Concrete Steps

Work from `/Users/dave/.codex/worktrees/498d/bifrost`.

Regenerate the vendored grammar after editing `grammar.js`:

    cd vendor/tree-sitter-scala
    npx --yes tree-sitter-cli@0.25.9 generate

The generated files must be deterministic on a second run. Inspect `git diff --stat` and confirm that only the expected grammar, generated parser, provenance, epoch, plan, and test files changed.

Run focused tests as they are added:

    cargo test --lib analyzer::scala::language::tests
    cargo test --test scala_analyzer_test issue_1068
    cargo test --test searchtools_definition_selectors issue_1068
    cargo test --test mcp_property_fuzzer issue_1068
    cargo test --lib scala_parser_epoch

Use the exact Chisel checkout and the one-shot CLI:

    cargo run --bin bifrost -- \
      --root /path/to/chisel \
      --tool get_symbol_sources \
      --sources svsim/src/test/scala/BackendSpec.scala \
      --args '{"symbols":["svsimTests.VCSSpec"]}'

The source result must start on line 16, end on line 234, and include the body. Repeat with `search_symbols` for `VCSSpec`, `finishRe`, `backend`, and `compilationSettings`; fields must no longer be empty.

Run the package and CI-equivalent validation:

    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    scripts/check-crate-package.sh
    scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh cargo test --features nlp,python

The package check must remain under its configured compressed-size budget. Clippy must emit no warnings, and the feature-enabled test suite must pass.

## Validation and Acceptance

Acceptance requires the compact empty-lambda source and the exact Chisel file to parse without `ERROR` or missing nodes. The empty callback must be represented as a `lambda_expression` whose parameter is the wildcard and whose body is absent, not as recovery syntax.

Self-type-only braced and indented templates must remain `self_type` nodes. The enum control from upstream PR #551 must retain its self type and private case. Existing #1016 annotated constructors and #1073 contextual `extension` tests must remain green.

`get_symbol_sources("svsimTests.VCSSpec")` must return the complete class body rather than line 16 only. `search_symbols` must independently return `finishRe`, `backend`, and `compilationSettings`, and `get_summaries` must list later declarations in `BackendSpec.scala`. The MCP property fuzzer must report no `(I1, scala, index, declaration-truncated-at-parse-error)` violation for the compact fixture or exact Chisel witness.

Persisted analysis created under the pre-#1068 Scala epoch must be treated as missing after the new parser is installed. Other language epochs and blobs must remain untouched.

## Idempotence and Recovery

The grammar generator is deterministic when run with 0.25.9. If a second generation changes files, stop and identify toolchain or source drift rather than accepting nondeterministic output. Do not use a globally installed unpinned CLI.

The exact Chisel replay must use ephemeral cache mode or a one-shot source-restricted workspace so it does not leave `.brokk/bifrost_cache.db` in the clone. Cargo validation should use `scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh` where specified so temporary build directories are removed automatically.

If an official tree-sitter-scala release containing PR #551 appears before completion, test that release together with the #1073 behavior before changing course. Remove private compilation only if the published parser passes the empty-lambda, self-type, annotated-constructor, and contextual-`extension` controls.

## Artifacts and Notes

Current failure:

    {"sources":[{"start_line":16,"end_line":16,
      "text":"class VCSSpec extends BackendSpec"}]}

Current symbol search:

    {"classes":[{"symbol":"svsimTests.VCSSpec"}],"fields":[],"functions":[]}

Raw current parser:

    root_has_error=true
    ERROR bytes=410..22749

Regenerated upstream PR #551 parser:

    root_has_error=false

Upstream release state checked on 2026-07-23:

    latest GitHub release: v0.26.0, published 2026-04-18
    latest crates.io package: tree-sitter-scala = "0.26.0"
    required fix merged: 88a12d30, 2026-07-21

## Interfaces and Dependencies

There are no public Rust, MCP, RQL, or serialized schema changes. The `tree_sitter_scala::LANGUAGE` development dependency remains pinned at 0.25.1 as a coexistence control, while production continues to use the private `brokk_bifrost_tree_sitter_scala` symbol compiled from `vendor/tree-sitter-scala`.

The only dependency used to regenerate source remains `tree-sitter-cli` 0.25.9. Builds and tests consume checked-in generated C and require no Node.js or network access.

Revision note: 2026-07-23 created this ExecPlan after confirming the issue on current Bifrost, verifying that no published upstream package contains the fix, and proving the merged upstream grammar against the exact Chisel witness.
