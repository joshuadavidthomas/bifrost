# Generalize receiver facts into value, dispatch, and heap oracles

This ExecPlan is a living document. Keep `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` current as implementation proceeds. Follow `.agents/PLANS.md` when revising it. The broader platform roadmap is checked in at `.agents/plans/language-agnostic-composable-typestate-platform.md`; this issue plan is self-contained and narrows that roadmap to GitHub issue #816.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Bifrost already has a language-neutral semantic IR, callable CFGs for every supported language, and one demand-materialized control-only ICFG. It also has useful but language-shaped receiver inference. What is missing is one honest, bounded semantic boundary through which later direct-flow, taint, typestate, IFDS/IDE, and optional pushdown clients can ask about dispatch targets, value transfer, and heap locations without importing a JavaScript, Java, usage-graph, or tree-sitter implementation.

After this change, `brokk_bifrost::analyzer::semantic` exposes three related contracts: `DispatchOracle`, `ValueFlowOracle`, and `HeapOracle`. Results use scoped semantic handles, candidate-level evidence, explicit candidate-set coverage, bounded call contexts and access paths, typed aliases, and a conservative strong-update certificate. TypeScript/JavaScript and Java provide two deliberately dissimilar reference implementations. The existing receiver query remains compatible but becomes a projection over the neutral facts instead of the owner of a parallel semantic model.

The observable result is not a whole-program pointer-analysis engine and not a solver. It is a finite, evidence-backed fact vocabulary and provider boundary. A later IFDS/IDE solver can intern these facts; a typestate FSA can name events and bound subjects through them; an optional WPDS implementation can attach weights to stable relations; and an optional synchronized call/field pushdown implementation can interpret exact call sites and access selectors as stack alphabets. None of those clients, weights, automata, worklists, or protocol states belongs in this issue.

For terminology in this plan, a finite-state automaton (FSA) is a finite protocol-state machine whose transitions may consume oracle-backed events. Interprocedural Finite Distributive Subset (IFDS) analysis tabulates finite dataflow facts with distributive transfer functions across matched calls and returns; Interprocedural Distributive Environment (IDE) analysis generalizes that model by propagating finite-height values through composable edge functions. A weighted pushdown system (WPDS) associates composable weights with call-stack transitions, while a synchronized pushdown system (SPDS) coordinates more than one stack, such as call and field/access-path stacks. These are prospective consumers of the finite relations defined here, not implementations supplied by #816.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-07-21 11:03+02:00) Verified the issue branch and live GitHub dependency state. Issues #394, #718, #719, #814, #815, and #818 are complete; #818 deliberately left actual/formal, receiver, return-value, and heap bindings to #816.
- [x] (2026-07-21 11:03+02:00) Read the durable platform roadmap, the #814 semantic-IR plan, the #718 receiver-traversal plan, and the all-language CFG/ICFG rollout plan.
- [x] (2026-07-21 11:03+02:00) Audited receiver inference, exact call relations, formal binding, Java receiver/return inference, semantic adapters, semantic identities/outcomes/gaps, workspace routing, and the existing dispatch/ICFG implementation.
- [x] (2026-07-21 11:03+02:00) Completed parallel architecture audits for current source seams and future IFDS/IDE, FSA, WPDS, and synchronized call/field pushdown consumers.
- [x] (2026-07-21 15:30+02:00) Froze the oracle quality, identity, limits, boundary-port, access-path, alias, and update-eligibility vocabulary in `src/analyzer/semantic/oracle.rs`. Twenty-one adversarial synthetic contract tests now cover scoped relation arenas, exact query/context ownership, store/base/root identity, validated call ports and bindings, bounded paths and sets, proof quality, and conservative strong updates.
- [x] (2026-07-21 15:30+02:00) Separated `WorkspaceSemanticOracle` from ICFG stitching, added explicit target-set coverage, replaced generic language checks with typed semantic-gap impacts, validated complete artifact generations, and preserved partial dispatch artifacts with exact work/provenance accounting. Existing C++ gap and Ruby non-regression behavior remains covered.
- [x] (2026-07-21 17:10+02:00) Completed the Ultra contract/dispatch checkpoint and its post-commit adversarial review. The initial architecture landed in `0f39b450`; follow-up hardening landed in `547a3057` with every accepted relation-arena, componentwise-quality, grouped-binding, finite-limit, cancellation, and target-projection finding. Independent validation passed 127 semantic unit tests, 41 oracle-contract tests, 11 semantic-IR tests, 25 ICFG-contract tests, 129 language-conformance tests, and 11 provider tests, plus formatting/diff checks and isolated strict all-target/all-feature Clippy. The earlier host-access feature suite passed 1,484 library tests with four intentional ignores and every integration target through `get_definition_test`; that stale branch target passed 565/568 and failed only the three C++ regressions corrected by upstream `0955e1c7` / PR #1020. A final remote refresh shows the issue branch is now fifteen commits behind `origin/master`; rebasing remains intentionally out of scope without user authorization.
- [x] (2026-07-21 19:01+02:00) Extracted the no-semantic-change lowering substrate in checkpoint `0621935c` and migrated all ten adapter modules covering eleven languages. `ProcedureLoweringSession` now owns dense source/evidence/value/call/gap allocation, point metadata, exact mapping publication, events, edges, gaps, and common call rows; `lower_procedure_batch` owns the repeated budget/cancellation policy. Ruby retains its binding prepass, C++ retains its distinct unconditional-`noexcept` throw terminal, and every adapter retains syntax, anchors, evaluation order, control topology, and gap policy. Validation passed 133 semantic unit tests, 25 ICFG contracts, 39 CFG contracts, 129 language-conformance cases, 41 oracle contracts, 11 IR contracts, 11 provider contracts, formatting/diff checks, and isolated strict all-target/all-feature Clippy.
- [x] (2026-07-21 19:47+02:00) Emitted real parameter, receiver, expression, scope-distinct local, assignment, allocation, return, call-actual/result/thrown, indexed-memory, and receiver-capture facts from the TypeScript/JavaScript and Java adapters in checkpoint `d74fc66f`. Shared source-backed fixtures cover shadowing, sibling same-name negatives, competing branch definitions, object and closure-environment allocation, indexed loads/stores, and exact lexical child capture. The focused semantic/CFG/ICFG/language/oracle/provider gates and isolated strict all-target/all-feature Clippy pass.
- [x] (2026-07-21 20:40+02:00) Implemented bounded `ValueFlowOracle` snapshots and candidate-specific `CallBindings` in checkpoint `4a777292`. Production relations now cover assignments, parameter/receiver/normal/exceptional ports, allocations, exact memory loads/stores, and exact lexical captures; call bindings cover receivers, direct and rest actuals, normal and exceptional results, and explicit open/truncated outcomes for spreads, omitted defaults, gaps, budgets, cancellation, and relation caps. The shared Java/TypeScript fixture also found and fixed TypeScript rest parameters hidden below `required_parameter` wrappers, with an adapter-version bump to invalidate stale cached multiplicity.
- [x] (2026-07-21 21:22+02:00) Implemented bounded `HeapOracle` points-to, location, alias, and update-eligibility queries in checkpoint `fe474cf4`. The oracle walks reaching definitions at the exact observation phase, retains allocation/procedure-port/location identities with candidate-specific evidence, marks loop and recursive allocation sites as summaries, truncates access paths with summary tails, and exposes only certificate-backed strong updates. TypeScript/JavaScript and Java now emit structured field loads/stores while retaining explicit field-identity gaps instead of equating same-spelled members. Focused heap contracts, strict all-target/all-feature Clippy, formatting, and diff checks pass.
- [x] (2026-07-21 22:19+02:00) Refined dispatch in checkpoint `04f5996d` through a neutral schema-v6 `DispatchExtensibility` procedure property. Java publishes closed evidence for constructors, static/private/final methods, and methods on final classes or records; ordinary virtual methods and enum methods remain open. The generic workspace oracle contains no language test and discharges a dynamic-dispatch gap only when every retained target is declaration-closed.
- [x] (2026-07-21 22:19+02:00) Routed the SearchTools `query_code` receiver path through generation-bound `HeapOracle` points-to facts while preserving the existing compatibility DTO. TypeScript/JavaScript retains structured label decoration constrained by neutral roots; Java now projects allocation, instance/static type, current receiver, factory, and exact member labels from neutral facts plus cached structured type/definition resolution. Prepared-file reuse, candidate caps, tiny budgets, cancellation, unsupported rows, and exact work accounting are covered.
- [x] (2026-07-21 23:20+02:00) Completed the predeclared release measurement with two warmups and five retained samples over inline TypeScript/Java plus clean pinned VS Code and Spring PetClinic revisions. The exact matrix, provenance, caps, medians, defects, and no-persistence decision are recorded in `.agents/docs/semantic-oracle-lifecycle-benchmark-2026-07-21.md`. Complete artifacts reuse fully for inline/PetClinic working sets; the 5,625-file VS Code sweep exceeds the byte-bounded cache and retains a median 460 pointer-identical artifacts. Oracle candidates remained at most four wide, access paths remained exact and one selector long, and disk/overlay invalidation plus cancelled-then-complete reuse remained correct.
- [x] (2026-07-22 00:00+02:00) Completed the final review and Rust gates in checkpoint `858ab44c`. Review corrected the schema-v6 stable digest that the dispatch-extensibility bump had left at the schema-v5 value. `cargo fmt -- --check`, `git diff --check`, focused semantic/CFG/ICFG contracts, and isolated strict all-target/all-feature Clippy pass. The host-access `nlp,python` gate passes all 1,508 library tests (four intentional ignores), doctests, cache-isolated MCP/CLI/SearchTools targets, and every integration target except four assertions inherited from the issue branch's `a84d6df4` base; current upstream `0955e1c7` / PR #1020 changes those exact three C++ navigation cases and the one default-argument expectation. The remaining integration tail is green. The durable roadmap is updated; the GitHub issue record and closure intentionally wait for a publication session because this branch is local-only and repository rules prohibit an unrequested push or rebase.
- [x] (2026-07-22 09:28+02:00) Completed the publication architecture pass. Shared lowering now owns mechanical declaration-path, multiplicity, source-anchor, field-child, preflight, and provider plumbing while adapters retain syntax policy; workspace-oracle staging/evidence, source-range points-to projection, semantic-gap impacts, receiver budget mapping, and budget reports each have one implementation. Source freshness is an atomic key-plus-bytes snapshot, heap summary depth is operational, path-specialized source observations remain distinct, Java member targets reuse the exact resolver, and receiver setup traversal is bounded. Formatting and diff checks pass; pinned rustup all-target/all-feature Clippy is warning-free; focused semantic, oracle, provider, receiver, Java, TypeScript, LSP, and source-freshness suites pass. The serialized all-feature library gate passes 1,503 tests and exposes only the four previously recorded stale-base assertions plus two deliberate cache-root tests perturbed by the run-wide ephemeral override; both cache-root tests pass when rerun under their contract environment.
- [x] (2026-07-22 09:51+02:00) Completed the independent post-review hardening. The review found that source-range observation discovery bounded retained rows but not traversal, duplicated receiver-oracle outcome translation, silently collapsed operational provider failures into `Unknown`, and bypassed the new shared tree walker in two setup paths. Source projection now has its own finite observation limit, charges and cancels a single value scan plus two point scans per selected procedure, and transactionally reports attempted work. Java and JavaScript/TypeScript share one receiver bridge and one bounded named-tree walk; provider failures surface as the distinct `receiver_analysis_failed` diagnostic. The two source regressions, ten receiver-query tests, oracle-limit validation, and diagnostic exhaustiveness pass. Final formatting/diff checks and pinned all-target/all-feature Clippy pass. The serialized all-feature library gate now passes 1,504 tests with four intentional ignores and retains only the same four stale-base assertions plus the two suite-override cache-root cases; both cache-root cases pass independently without the override.
- [x] (2026-07-22 16:10+02:00) Rebased the publication branch onto `origin/master` at `b2c78519` and completed the final architecture cleanup. Semantic-gap capabilities and consumer impacts are now distinct: generic deferred execution weakens deferred effects, while `CallEvaluation` is reserved for represented call sites whose caller-side evaluation or transfer is incomplete. Semantic IR schema v7 centrally invalidates every cached adapter artifact. Each bounded Java resolver expansion now uses a cancellable, budgeted `JavaResolutionSession`; source preparation, parent walks, structured queries, hierarchy resolution, and Cartesian candidate projection compose their work in the same operation-wide ledger, and candidate caps are checked before row construction. Post-rebase validation passes 15 receiver-query tests, 611 definition/type-resolution tests, 130 semantic-language conformance tests, 144 Scala usage-graph tests, all 1,617 enabled library tests with five intentional ignores, every all-feature integration target, matching-toolchain doctests, formatting, diff checks, and isolated strict all-target/all-feature Clippy.
- [x] (2026-07-22 17:10+02:00) Completed the final publishability sweep after the large-file architecture review. Lexical receiver demand now relays through arbitrarily deep lambda chains in one cancellable reverse pass, stopping at adapter-owned non-relaying boundaries. Java anonymous classes and JavaScript/TypeScript nested class field/static-block execution no longer leak receiver or local facts outward, while class heritage and computed method names retain their surrounding evaluation context. Adapter-local discovery scans and local prepasses poll cancellation, and changed adapter fingerprints invalidate stale artifacts. Independent review is clean. Validation passes three relay tests, two deterministic scan-cancellation tests, all 13 value-language contracts, all 130 language-conformance contracts, all 1,579 enabled no-feature library tests with five intentional ignores, formatting, diff checks, and isolated strict all-target/all-feature Clippy. Topology-only decomposition and the remaining JS/TS initializer receiver model are tracked separately in #1081, #1082, and #1083.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: `DispatchOracle` already exists and performs exact source-location dispatch through `CallRelationService`; it is currently declared and implemented inside `src/analyzer/semantic/icfg.rs`.
  Evidence: `DispatchCandidate`, `DispatchBoundary`, `DispatchResult`, and `DispatchOracle` are defined near the top of that module, and `WorkspaceIcfgProvider::resolve_call` maps one scoped `CallSiteHandle` back to an `ExactCallLocation` before invoking `dispatch_at_bounded`.

- Observation: the semantic IR already has neutral rows for local/parameter/receiver/return values, allocations, field/static/index/lexical-cell/capture locations, capture bindings, calls, proof, completeness, and typed uncertainty.
  Evidence: `src/analyzer/semantic/ir.rs` and `provider.rs` already expose these rows plus materialization-scoped handles and `SemanticOutcome<T>`.

- Observation: the TypeScript and Java production adapters do not yet populate enough of those rows to answer sound value or heap questions. They create call-local placeholder values, but do not connect expression results to actuals, emit parameter rows, allocations, memory rows, or general value-flow effects.
  Evidence: the call lowering in `src/analyzer/js_ts/semantic.rs` and `src/analyzer/java/semantic.rs` creates receiver/argument/result temporaries at the invoke point; repository-wide searches find no production `SemanticEffect::ValueFlow`, `Allocation`, `MemoryLoad`, or `MemoryStore` emissions in those adapters.

- Observation: the repeated lowering mechanics had two genuine adapter-owned exceptions rather than ten identical copies.
  Evidence: Ruby charges a parser-ordered local-binding prepass before procedure emission, while unconditional C++ `noexcept` routes the function scope to a distinct terminal point. The shared batch driver accepts precomputed work, and the shared session offers an optional separate function-throw boundary, preserving both contracts without importing Ruby or C++ syntax.

- Observation: the existing receiver outcome conflates three independent properties: whether each candidate is proven, whether the candidate set is exhaustive, and whether one abstract object represents one or many runtime objects.
  Evidence: `ReceiverAnalysisOutcome::Precise(Vec<_>)` can contain several candidates, `ReceiverValue::InstanceType` is nominal rather than a heap identity, and one allocation-site candidate can represent repeated loop or recursive allocations.

- Observation: some current receiver caps silently lose coverage. The TypeScript type-annotation path takes the first `max_targets` values before classifying the result, so a bounded subset can appear precise.
  Evidence: `src/analyzer/usages/js_ts_graph/receiver_analysis.rs` applies `.take(max_targets)` in the annotation path without retaining a truncated-set marker.

- Observation: the advertised receiver context-depth limit is not operational. JavaScript uses a separate fixed recursion bound and Java return-chain inference uses another fixed bound.
  Evidence: `ReceiverAnalysisBudget::context_depth` participates in query/cache values but is not consumed by the provider; JavaScript and Java declare independent hard-coded recursion limits.

- Observation: shared formal binding is structurally valuable but is not yet a semantic binding. It maps source ranges and `CodeUnit`s, reparses callee source, and can report `Complete` while leaving a spread actual unmapped.
  Evidence: `bind_call_site_arguments` and `formal_parameter_slots` in `src/analyzer/usages/call_relations.rs` and `src/analyzer/lexical_definitions.rs`.

- Observation: generic dispatch still contains two C++ language tests to decide which gaps weaken a retained call target set. Repeating that pattern for value and heap queries would make every neutral consumer language-aware.
  Evidence: `scoped_cpp_preprocessor_call_gap` and `scoped_cpp_call_evaluation_gaps` in `src/analyzer/semantic/icfg.rs`.

- Observation: the first contract draft allowed unrelated dense relation IDs and subjectless alias/escape flags to justify a strong update, including at a point with no store event.
  Evidence: specialist review constructed collisions between relation `0` from independent materializations and identified the positive test's `Invoke` point as a non-store. The revised contract resolves every relation through one query-owned arena and requires a `MemoryStoreHandle`, store-bound alias witness, store-bound escape witness, and one exact strong-update arena owner.

- Observation: a source revision and workspace mount are not enough to validate a retained semantic handle against a provider generation.
  Evidence: `SemanticArtifactKey` also includes language/dialect, adapter semantics, IR schema, configuration, and dependency fingerprints. `ProgramSemanticsProvider::current_artifact_key` now derives that complete key from a bounded atomic syntax snapshot without lowering, and dispatch rejects any mismatch before source projection.

- Observation: dispatch work accounting originally mixed transient resolver rows with retained candidates and omitted final reason strings, cancellation partials, and relation provenance.
  Evidence: the extracted provider now charges resolver examination separately, then atomically charges the final candidate/boundary rows, their owned proof text, and their arena record/evidence/handle entries. A payload that cannot be charged is not published.

- Observation: matching only the final field or index selector lets an unrelated base value masquerade as the store's address.
  Evidence: the post-implementation contract review constructed two paths with the same final selector and different roots. `StoreAtPoint` now requires the exact pre-effect base observation, validates the structured root against that base, and accepts exactly one field or index selector. Nested paths remain conservative until the lowering can supply structured prefix proof.

- Observation: query-local relation IDs are still unsafe if the arena owner omits the full point, phase, context, or candidate subject.
  Evidence: the adversarial contract suite could otherwise reuse evidence between similar points-to, location, alias, call-binding, or strong-update observations. Every result now validates one arena, the exact structured owner, the expected relation kind, nonempty evidence, and proof/completeness no stronger than the underlying semantic evidence.

- Observation: capping raw resolver declarations before semantic projection undercounts useful unique dispatch procedures, while cancellation and caps are independent states.
  Evidence: workspace dispatch now budgets raw resolver exploration separately, applies `dispatch_targets` only after deduplicating materialized procedures, retains partial artifacts for non-complete outcomes, and reports inner `Truncated` coverage whenever any cap occurred even when the outer outcome remains `Cancelled`.

- Observation: this host exposes rustup and Homebrew Rust components with incompatible artifact identities, and macOS PyO3 extension tests need CI's dynamic-symbol lookup flags.
  Evidence: the initial Clippy attempt produced E0514 because rustup `cargo` discovered Homebrew `cargo-clippy`; invoking rustup's `cargo-clippy` by absolute path keeps both halves on LLVM 22.1.2. The initial full `nlp,python` link failed on unresolved `_Py*` symbols; the corrected gate pins `.venv/bin/python` and supplies `-undefined dynamic_lookup` as `.github/workflows/ci.yml` does.

- Observation: the issue branch's complete suite cannot be green without integrating a known upstream C++ navigation fix that is unrelated to #816.
  Evidence: the branch was eight commits behind `origin/master` during the recorded host-access run and is fifteen behind after the final remote refresh. Both that full run and a serial 87-test C++ rerun fail only `cpp_bare_call_prefers_callable_role_over_same_named_nested_type`, `cpp_macro_decorated_out_of_line_owner_prefers_canonical_included_class`, and `cpp_qpid_qualified_template_and_macro_class_shapes_resolve_exact_types`; upstream `0955e1c7` / PR #1020 changes `src/analyzer/usages/get_definition/cpp.rs` and those expectations specifically. No checkpoint file modifies that navigation implementation or test target, and repository instructions prohibit an unrequested rebase.

- Observation: Java enum methods cannot be treated as declaration-closed merely because an enum type cannot be subclassed normally.
  Evidence: constant-specific class bodies may override a non-final enum method. The Java adapter therefore closes ordinary methods only for records and explicitly final classes; `enumTarget` remains open in the shared dispatch fixture.

- Observation: a neutral points-to candidate may intentionally remain a symbolic value without a nominal type, factory, or allocation label even when the structured compatibility query can render one.
  Evidence: factory-call and conditional receiver fixtures can retain symbolic roots at the neutral boundary while the existing structured projector retains exact `FactoryReturn`, `AllocationSite`, and nominal alternatives. The compatibility layer now requires a nonempty neutral root and uses structured analysis only to decorate that root into the stable DTO; exact neutral allocation identities must match the rendered file and range.

- Observation: the analyzer-only structural-query entrypoint cannot validate generation-bound semantic handles because it does not own a `WorkspaceAnalyzer`.
  Evidence: `execute_workspace` and `execute_workspace_with_limits` now carry the live workspace through query execution, and SearchTools uses that path. The analyzer-only entrypoint remains for internal callers and preserves its old TypeScript behavior; Java returns an explicit workspace-unavailable row there rather than manufacturing semantics.

- Observation: AST-level knowledge that a nested callable exists does not prove its parent procedure emitted the callable-creation and capture-binding rows.
  Evidence: the pinned VS Code scan found arrows below logical assignment and a broader unsupported parent control region. Capture slots now consult bindings emitted by the already-lowered lexical parent; an unbound receiver slot carries an explicit `Captures` gap instead of passing validation as exact.

- Observation: parameter flow is directional at the boundary even though either endpoint may carry the parameter role in validated IR.
  Evidence: assignment to a formal produces `value -> parameter`, while a read produces `parameter -> value`. The corpus projection exposed the old source-only assumption; parameter ports now preserve both directions and a focused source-backed regression covers the write case.

- Observation: a whole-corpus repeat is not a useful proxy for single-file warm reuse when the corpus exceeds the byte-bounded semantic cache.
  Evidence: inline and 49-file PetClinic runs retained every complete `Arc`; the 5,625-file VS Code repeat retained a median 460 and took 22.684 seconds versus 23.379 seconds cold because scan-order eviction outran reuse. Disk and overlay one-file generations still changed keys and reused the replacement artifact immediately.

- Observation: Java is the strongest static reference language. Its usage graph already has bounded declared-type, local/parameter, allocation, factory-return, overload, shadowing, and same-name-negative behavior that differs materially from JavaScript.
  Evidence: `src/analyzer/usages/java_graph/inverted.rs`, `return_type.rs`, `local_inference.rs`, and their focused Java usage tests.

- Observation: proof and completeness must be checked componentwise; a proven-but-partial row and an unproven-but-complete row cannot jointly justify a proven-complete result.
  Evidence: the post-milestone audit constructed asymmetric evidence sets for dispatch, value flow, points-to, and call bindings. Relation records and result constructors now require every claimed axis from the same supporting evidence, and argument cardinality counts only proven mappings.

- Observation: a call-scoped relation kind is not enough to identify a dispatch arm, and one visible relation handle retains its entire arena through `Arc`.
  Evidence: review could reseal one candidate relation for a different procedure, reuse one boundary relation across contradictory boundary kinds, and publish a narrow result backed by an arena built under wider record/evidence limits. Candidate records now name the exact `ProcedureHandle`, boundary records name the full `DispatchBoundaryKind`, and every public result revalidates all distinct retained arenas against its query limits.

- Observation: the old `Box<[ValueId]>` call-argument vocabulary cannot state direct versus spread arguments or one-versus-rest formals without language-shaped side channels.
  Evidence: schema v5 adds structured argument expansion/domain and formal multiplicity, while grouped candidate-specific bindings retain evidence-backed member mappings and proof-aware cardinality. Existing adapters publish `Unclassified` rather than manufacturing direct/spread semantics; TypeScript/Java refinement remains a later milestone.

- Observation: finite post-publication validation is too late when a public constructor or CFG builder can allocate unbounded iterators or owned language-domain text first.
  Evidence: candidate provenance and argument-group iterators now use bounded lookahead, call bindings have an explicit entry cap, object/location sets have typed breadth constructors, and `ProcedureCfgBuilder` prospectively charges language-defined value/rest/argument text before retention.

- Observation: cancellation, truncation, and exact target projection must remain independent even in partial workspace answers.
  Evidence: cancelled dispatch now groups semantic target identities before applying caps, preserves resolved targets as typed unmaterialized boundaries, reports inner `Truncated` coverage for omissions, and keeps outer `Cancelled` precedence over simultaneous budget states. Late materialization cancellation projects the current and remaining known target groups with cap-aware one-item lookahead rather than collecting an unbounded tail. Named boundary provenance uses target evidence; gap evidence retains its kind before handle deduplication.

- Observation: preserving cancellation at workspace dispatch is insufficient if a downstream ICFG projection or snapshot finalizer can relabel the same interrupted operation as budget exhaustion.
  Evidence: a failed call-transfer payload charge and an already budget-limited snapshot both previously selected `ExceededBudget` before inspecting cancellation. Dedicated finalizers now keep the outer result `Cancelled`, retain only atomically charged partials, and preserve independent inner truncation evidence.

- Observation: a procedure-wide C++ syntax-error gap means the adapter may have omitted call sites; it does not invalidate a different exact call that was retained and resolved.
  Evidence: removing `DispatchCoverage` from that procedure-wide `Calls` gap leaves call-scoped uncertainty intact, and the focused C++ semantic regression keeps the unrelated exact call proven and exhaustive.

- Observation: sharing the program-point source-occurrence allocator with value-only mappings destabilizes point selectors even though control topology is unchanged.
  Evidence: the first value slice caused cleanup and optional-chain point selectors to skip their prior anchor occurrences. Value rows now use the syntax occurrence itself (`0`) while only repeated program-point specialization advances the per-span occurrence allocator; all 39 CFG contracts pass with stable point identities.

- Observation: a finite syntax-backed value row should identify one static expression occurrence, not each dynamic evaluation or cleanup specialization.
  Evidence: call actuals, return sources, receiver expressions, and branch definitions now reuse one `ValueId` per tree-sitter node while program points remain path- and specialization-specific. The branch fixture retains two distinct defining expressions into one local without manufacturing path-specific runtime objects.

- Observation: the frozen intraprocedural snapshot validator could not express the roadmap's lexical capture relation because every endpoint was required to belong to the parent procedure.
  Evidence: production capture rows name a parent source and an exact child-procedure capture slot. `ValueFlowSnapshot` now permits only that one cross-procedure shape, verifies shared artifact identity, the child's exact lexical parent, and a matching parent `CaptureBinding`; an adversarial fixture proves that replacing the child capture port with another child port is rejected.

- Observation: TypeScript rest parameters can be wrapped in a `required_parameter` whose structured `pattern` child is the actual `rest_pattern`.
  Evidence: the first production variadic binding fixture published `FormalMultiplicity::One` and left its second direct actual unmapped. Inspecting the formal slot's tree-sitter fields exposed the wrapper; structured descendant classification now publishes the rest domain, both actuals bind the same formal port, and Java's distinct `spread_parameter` path remains green.

- Observation: one allocation-site handle is not evidence of one runtime object, even when the procedure CFG is acyclic.
  Evidence: the heap fixture observes the same static allocation identity as `Unknown` in an acyclic body and as `Summary` when a CFG back edge or repeated procedure in the call context proves repeated instantiation. A direct query before the allocation point returns no candidate.

- Observation: structured field syntax identifies the base expression and member occurrence but does not, by itself, identify a canonical declared field or prove a static receiver.
  Evidence: both reference adapters can emit exact field-shaped load/store events from tree-sitter fields, but neither adapter has resolver-backed declaration identity at lowering time. The emitted occurrence-local location therefore carries a typed heap/alias gap, and static-root queries remain explicitly unproven rather than merging fields by spelling.

- Observation: a lexical cell cannot be treated as nonescaping merely because its address is syntactically local.
  Evidence: an exact `CaptureBinding::Location` exports that cell into a child environment. Escape classification now checks capture bindings, and truncated contexts downgrade otherwise singleton lexical-cell cardinality before update eligibility is considered.

- Observation: an allocation-root location query must still respect the requested observation point and phase.
  Evidence: resolving a direct allocation root without tracing its result value made an allocation appear live before its event. Direct allocation roots now pass through the same point-sensitive reaching-definition traversal as value-root queries.

## Decision Log

- Decision: separate candidate proof, candidate-set coverage, and abstract-object cardinality.
  Rationale: `Proven`, `Exhaustive`, and `Singleton` answer different questions. An exhaustive set may contain several candidates; a proven nominal type may describe an open object set; and one allocation-site row may summarize many runtime objects. Strong updates require all relevant properties rather than inferring them from vector length or a `Precise` label.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: retain `SemanticOutcome<T>` as the operation-level uncertainty algebra and add `CandidateCoverage::{Exhaustive, Open, Truncated}` inside candidate-set results.
  Rationale: cancellation, unsupported capability, budget exhaustion, partial values, and unproven work are operation states, while target-set closure is a property of the returned set. A successfully completed open-world query must not masquerade as exhaustive, and an exhaustive multi-candidate result remains representable.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: use materialization-scoped semantic handles for live oracle operations. Persistent or summary keys must derive from the complete artifact validity key plus scoped semantic identity and oracle configuration; `Arc` pointer identity, `ProjectFile`, `CodeUnit`, FQN, range, or a bare dense ID is never a persistent key.
  Rationale: handles prevent cross-artifact and cross-procedure ID confusion in hot analysis. Exact artifact revision, adapter, configuration, dependencies, oracle limits, and oracle semantics version are required to reuse a canonical fact. Incomplete results may retain canonical-looking keys but never populate a complete cache entry.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: model stable procedure boundary ports for receiver, formal parameter, normal return, exceptional return, and capture slot.
  Rationale: `CallBindings` and reusable summaries need symbolic endpoints that survive caller/callee rebasing. Actual-to-formal and return-to-result relations are value metadata, not ICFG control edges.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: make `CallBindings` candidate-specific. One binding result names one exact call site and one candidate callee, then maps caller receiver/actual values to callee ports and callee return/throw ports back to caller result slots.
  Rationale: overloads and dynamic dispatch can select procedures with different formal layouts. Merging bindings before choosing a callee would manufacture cross-target parameter and return relations.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: represent call arguments as structured direct, spread, or unclassified rows; represent formals as one or domain-specific rest slots; and bind them through evidence-backed argument groups.
  Rationale: rest/spread expansion is one-to-many and may be open or truncated, so a flat actual-to-formal pair list cannot distinguish an exact empty spread from an omitted mapping. Group coverage and proof-aware `Exact`, `Between`, or `AtLeast` cardinality preserve both axes without embedding JavaScript, Python, or Java rules in the neutral contract.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: make dispatch provenance arm-specific and seal candidates only after the complete result validates the exact call, target, boundary fact, quality, uniqueness, and query limits.
  Rationale: call ownership alone allowed one valid relation to be reused for a contradictory target or boundary subtype. Full structured subjects make candidate-specific bindings and deferred ICFG projection consume the same exact fact that dispatch published.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: apply oracle limits to the complete retained object graph, not only visible vectors, and bound iterator consumption before collection.
  Rationale: one relation handle retains every record and evidence handle in its arena. Result constructors therefore aggregate distinct arenas, candidates reject duplicate or over-limit provenance with one-item lookahead, call groups and bindings have an explicit entry limit, and typed object/location sets prevent selecting the wrong breadth dimension.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: outer cancellation takes precedence over simultaneous budget interruption while inner coverage continues to record independent truncation.
  Rationale: operation timing must not flip an otherwise identical cancelled query into `ExceededBudget`, whether interruption occurs during target materialization, call-transfer projection, or snapshot finalization. Consumers need both facts: the operation stopped because of cancellation, and a finite cap may also have omitted target arms. Known resolver targets remain typed partial boundaries, but construction stops at the applicable target, record, or evidence cap and records the omission as `Truncated`.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: define an access path as a symbolic root, a bounded sequence of typed selectors, and an explicit `Exact` or `Summary` tail.
  Rationale: allocation-only roots cannot represent reusable relations such as `parameter0.connection -> return.state`. When a path limit is reached, the result must preserve a wildcard/summary tail and incomplete coverage; silently shortening the path and calling it exact is unsound. Exact call-site identities and exact field/index selectors remain usable as future call- and field-stack alphabets without embedding a pushdown system here.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: make value and access-path queries point-, phase-, and bounded-context-aware.
  Rationale: a bare value or location ID does not identify whether the query occurs before or after an assignment, store, call, or return. The context is language-neutral and bounded; it does not depend on an ICFG snapshot node or solver state.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: make oracle relation identity a handle into one finite, query-owned arena rather than publishing a bare dense integer.
  Rationale: dense IDs are useful only inside their owner. Arena pointer identity prevents collisions between independent queries, a structured owner ties relations to the exact call, procedure, call/callee pair, heap observation, or store event, and resolvable evidence records let future clients intern facts without treating an integer as persistent provenance.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: retain the complete query subject and bounded context in relation ownership and result wrappers, and expose only validated result construction.
  Rationale: a procedure or dense value ID alone cannot distinguish otherwise similar observations. `PointsToResult`, `LocationResult`, `AliasResult`, `ValueFlowSnapshot`, `CallBindings`, `DispatchResult`, and strong-update evidence reject mixed arenas, owners, contexts, kinds, empty evidence, contradictory coverage, and quality claims stronger than their IR witnesses.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: bind strong-update provenance to an exact `MemoryStore` event, not merely a point, path, and value.
  Rationale: one point can contain several effects, and alias or escape evidence about another store must not authorize replacement. `MemoryStoreHandle` names the event index and validated IR location/value; the strong-update arena owner and subject-bearing witnesses repeat that exact identity.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: preserve candidate proof when a dispatch-coverage gap opens the target set, and apply caller-side call-evaluation gaps only while constructing ICFG transfers.
  Rationale: proof that one target is real does not prove the set is closed, and uncertainty in argument/default/temporary evaluation does not invalidate the target identity. The direct dispatch oracle therefore retains proven candidates with `Open` coverage, while ICFG transfer completeness records evaluation uncertainty.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: let finite caps take precedence for result-set coverage while preserving the operation-level outcome independently.
  Rationale: cancellation answers whether the operation finished; `Truncated` answers whether a known finite bound omitted candidates or boundaries. A capped cancelled query must retain both facts rather than relabeling the candidate set as merely open.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: derive and compare the complete current `SemanticArtifactKey` before accepting a retained procedure handle in a workspace oracle.
  Rationale: matching source bytes cannot detect adapter, configuration, dependency, language, or IR-schema changes. The bounded identity-only provider path reuses atomic syntax preparation and the canonical key builder without lowering or populating caches.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: expose `MustAlias`, `MayAlias`, and `Disjoint` as explicit evidence-backed results, and expose update eligibility as either `Strong(StrongUpdateCertificate)` or `Weak(reasons)`.
  Rationale: a strong update is a proof obligation, not a convenience inferred from one candidate. Its certificate is scoped to a store, context, and heap abstraction and requires exhaustive singleton-location coverage, singleton object cardinality, an exact path, complete alias/escape evidence, and proven evidence. The certificate contains no client fact set so solver transfer functions do not become silently non-distributive.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: treat factory-return nesting as provenance on a returned object or relation, not as a second abstract object or memory location.
  Rationale: the factory call explains why an object candidate reached the receiver; it does not allocate another identity by itself.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: relocate the public dispatch contract to `semantic::oracle` and bind a separate workspace oracle provider to one `WorkspaceAnalyzer` generation. `WorkspaceIcfgProvider` delegates to it and continues to own only call/return control stitching.
  Rationale: dispatch is a reusable semantic service for ICFG, CodeQuery, and later solvers. Reusing exact `CallRelationService` resolution avoids a second resolver while removing ICFG as the public owner of dispatch.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: attach typed impacts to semantic gaps and make generic dispatch/return logic select gaps by impact and scope, not by language or detail text.
  Rationale: capability says what producer surface is incomplete; impact says which downstream inference may be weakened. A C++ preprocessing gap can affect dispatch coverage while a Ruby procedure-level `Calls` gap need not weaken a retained explicit call. This distinction must be authored structurally by adapters, not inferred from language names or message strings.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: use TypeScript/JavaScript and Java as the reference pair, then pressure-test the contract on C# or Rust before broad rollout.
  Rationale: JavaScript supplies the richest existing receiver provider; Java supplies materially different static inference and strong negative fixtures. Two similar dynamic adapters would not validate the neutrality of values, ports, locations, or dispatch closure.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: centralize finite emission mechanics in `ProcedureLoweringSession`, but leave syntax interpretation, evaluation order, topology, source-anchor selection and occurrence policy, prepasses, and uncertainty in each adapter. Shared lowering owns only the mechanical conversion from a selected tree-sitter node to a `SourceAnchor`.
  Rationale: dense IDs, provenance rows, matched call events, budget staging, cleanup-point registration, and byte-accurate anchor construction are representation invariants shared by every adapter. Moving AST interpretation into the same abstraction would erase the exact language distinctions the IR is meant to preserve. An optional separate function-throw boundary is a neutral topology hook, not a C++ policy encoded in the shared layer.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: make source freshness one atomic provider operation returning both the complete artifact key and the exact `Arc<str>` bytes that produced it.
  Rationale: checking a key and then rereading source admits a generation race and duplicates overlay/disk reads and hashing. Consumers now validate and project from one snapshot; parsing remains a later materialization gate, so freshness discovery does not pretend malformed source is lowerable.
  Date: 2026-07-22.

- Decision: retain only operational oracle limits and define `summary_depth` as the maximum transitive producer-edge depth followed by heap reaching-definition queries.
  Rationale: phantom interning limits implied guarantees the implementation did not enforce. A real depth boundary returns typed truncation without fabricating an object, participates in trace identity, and keeps heap walks finite for future solver clients.
  Date: 2026-07-22.

- Decision: centralize receiver consumers on generation-bound source points-to observations while preserving every path-specialized observation and reusing language resolvers only for compatibility labels and exact member selection.
  Rationale: choosing an arbitrary maximum point ID discarded valid access-path distinctions, and maintaining a Java-only member selector duplicated arity, callable-kind, and inheritance rules. The neutral source query owns availability, bounds, and evidence; existing structured resolvers decorate or select without becoming a second points-to model.
  Date: 2026-07-22.

- Decision: give source-to-point projection its own `source_observations` breadth limit and charge the semantic work budget for every procedure, value, source mapping, point, and retained entry traversed.
  Rationale: alias breadth bounds a different semantic relation and cannot stand in for source occurrences. Retained-row caps alone do not bound discovery work; staged charging and cancellation make a tiny receiver/LSP budget effective even on a large procedure while preserving transactional caller-budget semantics.
  Date: 2026-07-22.

- Decision: project one scalar consumer work limit only once across semantic dimensions and execution phases; classify nested source-candidate and observation work as scope traversal; and never commit staged facts from a failed phase.
  Rationale: independently granting the same cap to setup, semantic projection, compatibility decoration, scope traversal, and summary expansion turns a caller's finite limit into a phase- or dimension-multiplied allowance. One aggregate ledger and an explicit scope/summary partition keep reported work within the caller's cap, while transactional staging prevents budget exhaustion or cancellation from publishing partial facts.
  Date: 2026-07-22.

- Decision: intern expression values by structured AST node inside each procedure and keep value provenance independent from repeated program-point anchor occurrences.
  Rationale: the neutral IR is a finite static abstraction. One expression occurrence may execute on several paths or through several cleanup specializations, but its source-backed value identity remains stable; program points still carry every control occurrence. This also keeps call actuals, returns, allocations, and memory bases comparable without coupling consumers to lowering traversal order.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: make the first reference-language memory and capture slice deliberately exact and narrow: structured index loads/stores plus lexical receiver capture by value.
  Rationale: tree-sitter exposes array/subscript base and index expressions without a resolver side channel, and both Java lambdas and JavaScript arrows have a precise lexical-receiver case. Field/static locations, destructuring, mutable lexical cells, and general free-variable capture require the broader points-to/location work in Milestone 5; claiming them from names alone would violate the structured-resolution boundary.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: let value-flow snapshots project allocation and memory events into access-path-shaped locations now, but retain `ObjectCardinality::Unknown` until the heap oracle proves a singleton or summary abstraction.
  Rationale: allocation, load, and store dependencies are already exact neutral relations needed by direct-flow clients, while loop/recursive allocation cardinality and alias breadth belong to Milestone 5. Publishing an exact root/path with unknown cardinality preserves useful identity without smuggling in a strong-update claim.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: treat call bindings as conditional on one sealed dispatch candidate and derive binding coverage only from exact caller/callee ports, structured argument expansion, relevant typed gaps, and finite interruption state.
  Rationale: dispatch proof answers whether the candidate is a real target; candidate-specific binding closure answers whether every receiver, actual member, required formal, and result port is represented if that target is taken. Direct/rest mappings may therefore be exact even in an open dispatch set, while spreads, omitted defaults, incomplete bodies, and missing receiver conventions remain explicitly open.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: make parent-source to exact lexical-child capture-port flow the only cross-procedure relation admitted by `ValueFlowSnapshot`.
  Rationale: captures are lexical data transfer rather than invocation bindings, so placing them in `CallBindings` would invent a call site. The exact `CaptureBinding` row already proves parent, child, source, destination slot, environment, and mode; every other cross-procedure endpoint remains invalid.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: derive heap candidates from semantic events and CFG predecessor edges at the exact query point, using an iterative bounded traversal.
  Rationale: point-sensitive reaching definitions prevent future allocations and overwritten values from appearing early, while explicit stacks, evidence caps, candidate caps, and cancellation checks keep loops and deeply nested control flow finite and stack-safe.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: keep allocation-site cardinality `Unknown` unless repeated execution is structurally established, and use `Summary` for loop or recursive-context allocation sites.
  Rationale: acyclicity does not prove a procedure executes once, so it cannot justify `Singleton`. Repetition evidence is sufficient to disprove singleton identity, while no current production fact proves unique dynamic allocation strongly enough to enable a strong update.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: publish occurrence-local field memory facts with typed uncertainty until resolver-backed declaration identities are available.
  Rationale: retaining the structured base and selector is useful to value and heap clients, but merging field occurrences by source text or declaring a static field from receiver spelling would violate the structured-resolution boundary. The gap keeps points-to, alias, and update results honestly open.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: require update eligibility to inherit exact location coverage, object cardinality, alias, escape, path, context, store, and evidence limits componentwise.
  Rationale: a single returned location is not a singleton-address proof. Captured cells, wildcard paths, summarized allocations, unresolved value roots, truncated contexts, and publication-budget failures must all yield typed weak-update reasons rather than a certificate.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: keep FSA definitions, IFDS/IDE facts, WPDS weights, semirings, synchronized-stack state, worklists, and protocol state outside every oracle contract.
  Rationale: the oracles publish finite semantic relations. Clients decide whether those relations become plain set facts, lattice functions, FSA transitions, weights, or pushdown symbols. This preserves the baseline solver and leaves #826 evidence-gated.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: publish dispatch closure as a neutral declaration property and let the generic oracle consume only that property.
  Rationale: Java owns the language rules that prove constructors, static/private/final methods, and final owners non-overridable. The workspace oracle only needs to know whether every retained declaration is closed; a Java branch in the generic consumer would repeat the language policy and block future adapters from supplying equivalent evidence.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: make generation-bound points-to facts authoritative for receiver-query availability, bounds, and cancellation while retaining the structured receiver provider as a compatibility-label projector.
  Rationale: neutral abstract objects deliberately omit legacy `CodeUnit` labels such as factory nesting and nominal alternatives. Recreating those public DTO labels inside `HeapOracle` would pollute the reusable IR, while allowing the old provider to answer without a neutral root would preserve two competing semantic models. The projector may decorate symbolic roots but cannot bypass neutral unavailability, budget exhaustion, cancellation, exact allocation identity, or candidate truncation.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: retain complete semantic artifacts only in the existing byte-bounded generation cache and keep oracle relation arenas request-local; do not add SQLite persistence under #816.
  Rationale: the retained matrix proves correct complete-only reuse and bounded relation growth, but the large TypeScript working set exceeds the cache and broad projections remain nontrivial. No packed representation, write amplification, hydration cost, invalidation protocol, or cross-generation reuse gate was measured for raw artifacts or query-owned arenas. Reusable client-independent or solver summaries remain a separate #817/#823 measurement candidate.
  Date: 2026-07-21.

- Decision: separate producer capabilities from downstream consumer impacts. Generic deferred execution carries `DEFERRED_EFFECTS`; `CallEvaluation` is added only when an already represented call site has incomplete caller-side evaluation or transfer.
  Rationale: scheduling or omitted procedure work can make value, heap, alias, and return effects incomplete without weakening a nested call whose transfer is otherwise exact. Keeping those dimensions independent prevents an unrelated deferred construct from turning precise ICFG call transfer partial. Because the interpretation of gap rows changed across all adapters, semantic IR schema v7 provides the central cache invalidation boundary.
  Date: 2026-07-22.

- Decision: route each bounded Java resolver expansion through `JavaResolutionSession` and compose every compatibility phase in one aggregate work ledger.
  Rationale: source preparation, cancellation polling, parent traversal, exact enclosing-owner discovery, imports, hierarchy, structured type/definition queries, and allocation/type projection are one user-visible operation even though individual definition/type expansions have separate session lifetimes. Central accounting makes budgets compositional, keeps cached line starts free on warm reuse, prevents Cartesian candidate construction beyond the retained cap, and avoids an unbounded compatibility resolver beside the neutral oracle.
  Date: 2026-07-22.

- Decision: classify nested execution by structured AST child roles rather than pruning whole class or member nodes.
  Rationale: Java anonymous `class_body` execution and JS/TS field values, static blocks, callable bodies, and parameters belong to nested procedures, but JS/TS heritage expressions and computed member names execute in the surrounding class-definition context. The traversal keeps those outer-evaluated expressions visible, exempts only the current method body from its own boundary rule, and leaves complete field/static-initializer receiver ownership to #1083.
  Date: 2026-07-22.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

Issue #816 has completed its implementation, review, measurement, and publication validation milestones. Its contract/dispatch checkpoint, shared-lowering milestone, reference-language value-fact milestone, production value-flow/call-binding milestone, bounded heap-oracle milestone, receiver/dispatch-refinement milestone, measured lifecycle decision, and post-review schema checks are complete on the issue branch. Semantic IR schema v7 includes neutral declaration-backed dispatch extensibility in addition to the finite evidence-backed oracle vocabulary; exact query, dispatch-arm, and relation-arena ownership; structured direct/spread/unclassified arguments and one/rest formals; proof-aware grouped call bindings; bounded access paths, contexts, retained arenas, and partial target projection; strong-update proof obligations; explicit dispatch coverage; typed and consumer-specific gap impacts; complete artifact-key validation; stable cancellation semantics; and a separate workspace semantic facade. The lowering milestone removes the repeated emission engine from all language adapters while preserving their syntax and topology ownership.

TypeScript/JavaScript and Java production artifacts now contain exact formal and receiver ports, source-backed expression values, scope-distinct locals, assignment and local/parameter/receiver/return flows, direct and spread call actuals, results and thrown values, object and closure-environment allocations, indexed and field-shaped locations and loads/stores, and lexical receiver captures into exact child-procedure slots. `WorkspaceSemanticOracle` projects those rows into bounded, evidence-backed dispatch, value, binding, points-to, location, alias, and update-eligibility arenas without source reparsing or name/range matching. Source-to-point projection has an independent finite breadth limit, stages every traversal row against the semantic budget, and preserves path-specialized observations. Product receiver queries use this generation-bound facade, preserve operational provider failures, and retain legacy labels for both TypeScript/JavaScript and Java. The shared fixtures prove block shadowing, Java sibling-scope same-name negatives, competing branch definitions, observation-before-allocation, loop/recursive allocation summaries, branch joins, candidate and path truncation, distinct-allocation disjointness, capture-slot identity, wildcard indexes, field-identity uncertainty, static-root uncertainty, weak updates, direct/rest mappings, open defaults/spreads, closed and open dispatch, prepared-file reuse, budget partials, and cancellation. The Milestone 7 corpus sweep added emitted-binding-aware capture gaps, directional parameter-port projection, and conservative `Open` results for a Rust control-only adapter. Its five retained samples support generation-local complete artifacts, request-local oracle arenas, and no #816 SQLite persistence.

The publication rebase integrates the upstream navigation and workspace-query changes while preserving atomic semantic-cache acquisition and snapshot-aware keying. The final architecture audit additionally closes every identified budget-multiplication seam: source projection charges every traversal, receiver phases consume one aggregate ledger, CodeQuery projects its scalar fact cap across semantic dimensions once, and each bounded Java compatibility expansion uses the structured resolution session while contributing to that operation-wide ledger. Generic deferred work no longer weakens precise nested call transfer. The rebased tree passes the focused receiver, definition/type-resolution, conformance, and Scala regressions; all 1,617 enabled `nlp,python` library tests with five intentional ignores; every all-feature integration target; matching-toolchain doctests; formatting and diff checks; and isolated strict all-target/all-feature Clippy.

The publishability sweep keeps this implementation focused rather than moving thousands of validated lines before review. It centralizes receiver-demand relay, makes adapter discovery cancellation explicit, and separates nested execution from surrounding class-definition evaluation with behavior-focused Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript coverage. Follow-up #1081 owns semantic IR/oracle/workspace-oracle topology, #1082 owns language-local Java and JS/TS lowerer decomposition, and #1083 owns first-class JS/TS field/static initializer procedures and receiver contexts, including nested computed-name callables and static-block `this`.

## Context and Orientation

`src/analyzer/semantic/ids.rs`, `capabilities.rs`, `provider.rs`, and `ir.rs` own durable artifact validity, scoped dense IDs and handles, total language capabilities, finite semantic work budgets, typed operation outcomes, immutable semantic rows, evidence, and gaps. New oracle contracts build on these types rather than creating parallel source/range identities.

`src/analyzer/semantic/icfg.rs` owns demand-materialized interprocedural control. Public dispatch contracts live in `src/analyzer/semantic/oracle.rs`, and workspace-backed dispatch lives behind `WorkspaceSemanticOracle`. The ICFG delegates semantic call resolution to that facade and retains call-to-entry, matched exit-to-originating-continuation, and bounded snapshot construction.

`src/analyzer/usages/call_relations.rs` remains the authoritative structured, exact-source call resolver and source-level formal-layout algorithm. Oracle code adapts its results to scoped semantic procedures and values; it does not perform FQN-wide or text-search resolution.

`src/analyzer/usages/receiver_analysis.rs` and `js_ts_graph/receiver_analysis.rs` contain the compatibility behavior to preserve: allocation/type/static/module/current-receiver candidates, conditional merges, factory provenance, explicit outcomes, cancellation, and bounds. Their `CodeUnit`, file/range, and recursive DTO identities do not become the neutral oracle API.

`src/analyzer/usages/java_graph/inverted.rs`, `return_type.rs`, and `local_inference.rs` contain the static reference behavior. The semantic adapter should emit enough structured facts that usage graph and query consumers can reuse the oracle rather than copying this resolver again.

`src/analyzer/js_ts/semantic.rs` and `src/analyzer/java/semantic.rs` already emit real procedure and control topology. The next adapter milestone must add value identity and relations without manufacturing expression semantics from the current call placeholders. A shared lowering session may own source/evidence interning and emission mechanics, but language syntax interpretation stays in each structured adapter.

`WorkspaceSemanticOracle` holds a live `WorkspaceAnalyzer` and validates every retained handle against the complete current `SemanticArtifactKey` before projection. Live results use scoped handles. Oracle limits complement `SemanticBudget`: limits bound semantic breadth/depth such as candidates, context, summaries, alias expansion, and access paths, while `SemanticBudget` continues charging actual source bytes and retained/traversal work. Any future complete-result cache must include both the complete artifact key and oracle configuration in its identity; this checkpoint does not add an oracle-result cache.

## Plan of Work

### Milestone 1: freeze the language-neutral oracle contract and dispatch seam

Create `src/analyzer/semantic/oracle.rs` and export it from `semantic/mod.rs`. Move or re-export the existing dispatch types there. Add explicit `CandidateCoverage`, candidate-level evidence containers, `ObjectCardinality`, finite `OracleLimits`, bounded call context, evaluation phase, procedure boundary ports, access-path roots/selectors/tails, point-aware value/access/store queries, abstract objects and locations, value relations, candidate-specific call bindings, alias answers, weak-update reasons, and a validated strong-update certificate. Define `ValueFlowOracle` and `HeapOracle` method shapes over scoped handles and `SemanticOutcome<T>`; do not supply fake default answers.

Add `coverage` to `DispatchResult`. It defaults to `Open`, becomes `Truncated` whenever candidate discovery or materialization is capped, and becomes `Exhaustive` only when the resolver and all applicable gap evidence prove there is no unresolved arm. Candidate count never determines coverage.

Provide `WorkspaceSemanticOracle`, tied to one `WorkspaceAnalyzer` generation and validated `OracleLimits`. Reuse the existing exact call relation implementation. Make `WorkspaceIcfgProvider` delegate `DispatchOracle` calls to this facade and retain only control-transfer/snapshot responsibilities. Preserve public root re-exports so existing `analyzer::semantic::*` consumers continue to compile.

Add typed semantic-gap impacts for at least dispatch coverage, call evaluation, return transfer, value flow, heap read, heap write, and aliasing. Default impact derivation may conservatively follow capability and subject, but adapter-specific extra impacts must be explicit. Tag C++ preprocessing and caller-side evaluation gaps, tag dynamic-dispatch gaps generically, and replace the current C++ checks in generic dispatch. Use the same typed return-transfer impact for existing path-scoped return weakening. Bump the semantic IR schema version because gap rows change, update deterministic rendering, and add validation/tests that prevent unrecognized impact bits or empty impact claims where an exact consumer dependency is required.

Create `tests/semantic_oracle_contract.rs` with synthetic semantic artifacts. Prove at least:

- candidate proof, set coverage, and object cardinality vary independently;
- one candidate with `Open` coverage is not a closed dispatch result;
- an exhaustive multi-candidate set remains exhaustive;
- path truncation produces a `Summary` tail and never a shorter exact path;
- point/phase/context and procedure scopes participate in query identity;
- candidate-specific call bindings cannot mix callees;
- `StrongUpdateCertificate` rejects open/truncated points-to, multiple locations, summary objects, summary paths, incomplete alias/escape evidence, and unproven evidence;
- a complete singleton exact location with complete disjoint/non-escape evidence can receive a strong certificate;
- typed gaps weaken only the downstream facets they declare;
- every limit is positive and finite.

Run existing ICFG tests to prove the extraction is behavior-preserving, including C++ preprocessing/evaluation cases and the Ruby non-regression.

### Milestone 2: extract shared lowering mechanics without changing semantics

Extract a source-anchor-aware procedure lowering session and shared call-site scaffold from the repeated TypeScript/Java and all-language adapter mechanics. It may own deterministic source/evidence/value/call ID allocation, exact point metadata, effect insertion, and common validation. It must not interpret language syntax, parse source text, or force one universal visitor.

Re-run semantic language conformance and ICFG contracts for all languages. This milestone is a mechanical base for widening value emission, not permission to change capability claims or infer new facts.

### Milestone 3: emit real reference-language value facts

Extend TypeScript/JavaScript and Java lowering to emit procedure receiver and parameter rows, expression-specific values, lexical locals, assignments/aliases, allocations, returns, call actuals/results/thrown values, and basic captures. Use tree-sitter fields and existing structured analyzer declarations/inference. Preserve exact source/evidence identity and iterative traversal.

Connect actual expression values to call argument slots and returned expression values to procedure return ports. Do not derive sound-looking bindings from the current invoke-point placeholders. Update capability tables and gaps only for behavior proven by fixtures.

Add shared inline TypeScript/Java fixtures for locals, shadowing, branch ambiguity, object creation, factory return, calls, exceptions, captures, and same-name negatives. The two adapters may differ in evidence and open-world behavior but must publish the same neutral relation kinds where semantics agree.

### Milestone 4: implement value-flow and call bindings

Implement intraprocedural value-relation snapshots and candidate-specific `call_bindings`. Adapt the shared formal-slot selection logic to semantic ports rather than matching by FQN or range. Cover receiver-to-receiver, actual-to-formal, callee-return-to-caller-result, thrown-to-exceptional-result where modeled, and capture source-to-child slot as a separate lexical relation.

Defaults, named arguments, variadics, spreads, receiver conventions, and incomplete callee bodies must retain explicit coverage and proof. A spread actual with no mapped formal cannot produce a complete binding result. Charge every candidate, relation, source read, and summary expansion; honor cancellation between work units.

### Milestone 5: implement bounded heap, alias, and update queries

Emit and query allocation objects, fields, statics, exact/wildcard indexes, lexical cells, and capture slots. Implement point-aware points-to and access-path location queries, preserving candidate coverage and object cardinality. A capped path retains a summary tail; a capped candidate set retains exact discovered candidates plus `Truncated` coverage.

Implement evidence-backed alias answers. Default to `MayAlias` or an incomplete outcome when identity is not proven. Issue a strong-update certificate only when every constructor invariant passes; otherwise return `Weak` with typed reasons. Tests must include loop/recursive allocation-site summaries so one allocation handle is not accidentally treated as one runtime object.

### Milestone 6: refine dispatch and project receiver compatibility

Use value/type facts to refine dispatch only when evidence is sufficient. Add explicit exhaustive-coverage proof for Java static methods, constructors, private methods, and provably final methods/classes. Keep ordinary Java virtual dispatch and JavaScript property/callable dispatch open unless the indexed workspace and language semantics genuinely close them.

Route `ReceiverQueryService` through the oracle facade. Preserve `precise`, `ambiguous`, `unknown`, `unsupported`, and `exceeded_budget`; per-input reasons and limits; allocation/type/static/module/current/factory rendering; prepared-file accounting; and unsupported-language rows. Factory nesting becomes provenance rendering. Add Java receiver support without relabeling CodeQuery `points_to` as whole-program points-to.

Checkpoint `04f5996d` completes this milestone. The semantic schema records `DispatchExtensibility::{Open, Closed}` on each procedure, Java supplies the declaration proof, and the language-neutral workspace oracle removes a dynamic boundary only when all retained targets are closed. SearchTools now executes CodeQuery with its live workspace; the neutral heap query owns generation validity, work, limits, cancellation, and availability, while structured compatibility code decorates neutral roots into the stable DTO. Java uses one cached parse tree for source observation, type and definition resolution, and label projection.

### Milestone 7: measurement, review, and rollout decision

Measure cold/warm generation-local oracle construction, invalidation after disk and overlay changes, candidate counts, access-path lengths, alias breadth, retained provenance, and receiver-query compatibility overhead on inline fixtures plus pinned representative TypeScript and Java repositories. Incomplete results never populate a complete cache. Do not add SQLite persistence without a separate measured lifecycle decision.

Run parallel API/identity, soundness, adapter, budget/cancellation, compatibility, and future-consumer reviews. Pressure-test C# or Rust before declaring the contract portable. Update the broader roadmap, this plan, and issue #816 with exact validation and any intentionally deferred language rollout.

## Concrete Steps

Work from the existing issue branch. Do not create or switch branches. At every milestone, inspect `git status --short` and stage only files changed for that milestone.

Other semantic adapters and tests may require mechanical `SemanticGap` field initialization after the schema change. Do not mix reference value lowering into this checkpoint.

Format and run the focused contract first:

    cargo fmt
    cargo test --test semantic_oracle_contract --test semantic_ir_contract --test icfg_contract

Then run language conformance because every adapter emits gaps:

    cargo test --test semantic_language_conformance

Run the isolated CI lint gate:

    scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

Before the final issue completion, run the feature-complete suite:

    scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh cargo test --features nlp,python

Also run:

    cargo fmt -- --check
    git diff --check

After each completed ExecPlan milestone and its review fixes, commit only that milestone's files with a multiline message explaining the semantic reason for the checkpoint. Record the commit and validation in `Progress` and `Outcomes & Retrospective`.

## Validation and Acceptance

The contract checkpoint is accepted when `semantic_oracle_contract`, `semantic_ir_contract`, `icfg_contract`, and semantic language conformance pass; generic dispatch contains no language/dialect tests; `DispatchResult` carries explicit coverage; every gap used by dispatch/return selection carries typed impact; existing C++ and Ruby behavior remains intact; and specialist review finds no way to obtain a strong-update certificate from open, summary, ambiguous, unproven, or incomplete evidence.

Issue #816 is accepted when both TypeScript/JavaScript and Java can answer the same neutral dispatch/value/heap contracts from real adapter facts; receiver compatibility passes; every requested bound and cancellation path retains partial candidates and exact work; same-name and shadowing negatives do not fabricate relations; closed dispatch is evidence-backed; no text-search or mini-parser fallback was added; and direct-flow/ICFG clients can consume the oracles without importing language-specific graph modules.

The implementation must remain useful to the planned consumers without embedding them. A synthetic test should demonstrate that oracle relations have finite stable identity and can be interned as client facts, and that ports/access selectors can be interpreted as symbolic summary or future pushdown alphabets. No test should instantiate an FSA, IFDS solver, weight algebra, or synchronized pushdown engine inside the oracle module.

## Idempotence and Recovery

All source and plan edits are ordinary version-controlled files. Formatting and tests are repeatable. Semantic artifact caches are generation-local and complete-only; a failed or cancelled oracle query must not mutate a complete cache entry.

If the semantic-gap schema migration breaks an adapter, add the correct typed impact or an explicit empty impact when the gap is purely diagnostic; do not infer impact from detail strings and do not restore language checks in generic consumers. If the dispatch extraction changes behavior, compare the pre-extraction ICFG tests and move existing structured logic intact before attempting precision changes.

If a proposed strong certificate cannot prove one invariant, recover by returning `Weak` with the corresponding reason. If a candidate/path limit is exceeded, retain discovered exact candidates or selectors, mark coverage `Truncated` or the tail `Summary`, and return the appropriate budget/partial outcome. Never recover by dropping candidates, shortening a path as exact, matching by name, or scanning source text.

If TypeScript/Java facts pressure a provisional relation or endpoint shape, revise this living plan and the synthetic contract before broadening to other languages. Backwards compatibility is not required, but every revision must preserve scoped identity, boundedness, explicit uncertainty, and consumer separation.

## Artifacts and Notes

The most important existing behavior to preserve is:

    ReceiverAnalysisOutcome::{Precise, Ambiguous, Unknown, Unsupported, ExceededBudget}
    SemanticOutcome::{Complete, Ambiguous, Unknown, Unsupported, Unproven, ExceededBudget, Cancelled}
    CallRelationService::dispatch_at_bounded
    bind_call_site_arguments / formal_parameter_slots
    WorkspaceIcfgProvider matched call and return stitching

The key soundness distinction is:

    candidate proof != candidate-set coverage != object cardinality

The key ownership distinction is:

    ICFG: control topology
    ValueFlowOracle: caller/callee and intraprocedural value relations
    HeapOracle: objects, locations, access paths, aliases, update eligibility
    client/solver: facts, FSA states, weights, worklists, summaries

## Interfaces and Dependencies

The contract checkpoint should provide these shapes, allowing naming refinements that preserve their semantics:

The bounded call context is retained in each value-flow result and in its query-owned relation-arena identity; it is not transient request metadata. A call-binding query receives a validated `DispatchCandidate`, rather than an independently supplied callee handle, and its result retains the same context. An alias query is one validated observation whose operands share point, phase, and context. `StoreAtPoint` binds one exact `MemoryStore` event to the structured lvalue path and stored value observed before that effect; matching a field or index requires the full base/path relationship, not merely the final selector. Consequently `update_eligibility` takes the validated store subject alone and derives any selected abstract location and certificate evidence from that subject.

            request: &mut SemanticRequest<'_>,
        ) -> Result<SemanticOutcome<UpdateEligibility>, SemanticProviderError>;
    }

The query-bearing `PointsToResult`, `LocationResult`, and `AliasResult` wrappers retain the exact point, phase, and context subject and validate every candidate's provenance against it. `OracleSet::bounded` consumes at most the selected limit plus one candidate and forces `CandidateCoverage::Truncated` when that lookahead proves omission.

`WorkspaceSemanticOracle` supplies `DispatchOracle`, `ValueFlowOracle`, and `HeapOracle` over a live workspace plus one validated `OracleLimits` value. `WorkspaceIcfgProvider` may forward `DispatchOracle` for compatibility, but its call-transfer implementation consumes the separate facade rather than owning another resolver. SearchTools receiver traversal likewise receives the live workspace and projects neutral heap answers instead of constructing generation-free Java answers.

Nominal compatibility labels, external/module object refinement, stable relation-key serialization, and richer escape evidence remain possible later refinements. Their required identity, boundedness, proof, and coverage semantics are fixed by this plan even if their Rust layout changes; Milestone 7 must measure the implemented finite rows before proposing persistence or another representation.

Plan revision note (2026-07-21): Initial focused issue plan written after live dependency verification, full roadmap/semantic/ICFG review, and parallel current-surface plus future-consumer audits. It separates proof, coverage, and cardinality; introduces boundary ports and summary-tailed access paths; makes strong updates certificate-based; removes language checks through typed gap impacts; and deliberately ends the Ultra checkpoint before reference-adapter value/heap lowering so that routine implementation can continue under High reasoning.

Plan revision note (2026-07-21): Reconciled the durable contract narrative after specialist review without advancing implementation status. Renamed the generation-bound facade to `WorkspaceSemanticOracle`; made bounded context part of value-flow and call-binding results and relation ownership; made call bindings query a validated dispatch candidate; described aliasing as one same-observation query; and clarified that `StoreAtPoint` binds the exact store event, full structured address path, and stored value so `update_eligibility` does not accept an independently selected location. Added a self-contained glossary for the prospective FSA, IFDS, IDE, WPDS, and SPDS consumers.

Plan revision note (2026-07-21): Reconciled the implemented Ultra checkpoint after adversarial contract and workspace-dispatch review. Query-bearing result wrappers now retain exact observation identity; relation arenas validate full owners, contexts, evidence kinds, and evidence quality; store observations bind the exact base and root; public result construction is bounded and contradiction-checked; raw dispatch exploration is budgeted separately from final unique target caps; and typed gap scope drives ICFG weakening. This checkpoint deliberately stops before shared lowering, real TypeScript/Java value and heap facts, oracle implementations, receiver projection, dispatch refinement, and measurement.

Plan revision note (2026-07-21): Closed the post-commit Ultra audit after schema v5 grouped-call-binding hardening, whole-arena limit validation, exact dispatch target and full boundary subjects, cap-aware partial target retention, and cancellation-precedence fixes at workspace, call-transfer, and snapshot layers. The remaining milestones are implementation-oriented and can proceed under High reasoning.

Plan revision note (2026-07-21): Recorded Milestone 6 checkpoint `04f5996d`. Semantic schema v6 adds adapter-owned dispatch extensibility consumed without language tests by the generic oracle; Java closes only declarations whose language rules prove non-overridability. Product CodeQuery receiver traversal now carries a live workspace through the neutral heap facade, preserves TypeScript/JavaScript compatibility labels as decoration of neutral roots, adds Java label projection, and proves prepared reuse, exact work, truncation, budgets, cancellation, and SearchTools integration. Measurement and final rollout review are the only remaining milestones.

Plan revision note (2026-07-22): Recorded the final publication rebase onto `origin/master` at `b2c78519`, semantic IR schema v7 impact separation, and the bounded Java resolution cleanup. The integrated tree preserves atomic generation-aware cache acquisition and all workspace execution modes, charges and cancels every source-projection and receiver-compatibility traversal through aggregate ledgers, classifies source-candidate visits as scope work, partitions CodeQuery's scalar fact cap once, and proves Results/Profile parity before publication. The complete all-feature gate and strict Clippy pass on the publication tree.

Plan revision note (2026-07-22): Recorded the final large-file architecture sweep and publication hardening. The branch keeps the reviewed modules intact for #816, replaces quadratic receiver-capture relay with a shared cancellable reverse pass, and uses structured Java/JS/TS execution boundaries without losing outer heritage or computed-name evaluation. The three larger ownership seams are explicitly deferred to #1081, #1082, and #1083; focused contracts, the complete no-feature library gate, and strict isolated Clippy are green.
