# Milestone 2 inventory: the `IAnalyzer` split

Working document for milestone 2 of `.agents/plans/analysis-language-registry-spi.md`
(decision 4). Taken against `74bf60a3` (milestone 1f complete). It records what the
mechanical sweep found before any code moved, the membership adjudication for
`CodeUnitIndex`, the search-method decision, and the `*_for_test` hook census. The
decision-log section at the end is appended to during implementation, per decision 4's
instruction to record every per-method resolution.

## 1. Implementors

Sixteen `impl IAnalyzer for ...` blocks exist in the tree. Every one of them splits.

Counts below are the landed split (post-`cargo fmt`), so `stays on IAnalyzer` includes the
one added `test_hooks()` accessor per hook-owning implementor.

| Implementor | File | Methods | -> `CodeUnitIndex` | -> `AnalyzerTestHooks` | stays on `IAnalyzer` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CppAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/cpp/mod.rs` | 64 | 27 | 6 | 31 |
| `CSharpAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/csharp/mod.rs` | 68 | 28 | 10 | 30 |
| `GoAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/go/mod.rs` | 66 | 28 | 6 | 32 |
| `JavaAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/java/mod.rs` | 70 | 30 | 8 | 32 |
| `JavascriptAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/javascript/mod.rs` | 64 | 26 | 8 | 30 |
| `KotlinAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/kotlin/mod.rs` | 68 | 28 | 8 | 32 |
| `PhpAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/php/mod.rs` | 63 | 27 | 6 | 30 |
| `PythonAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/python/mod.rs` | 65 | 27 | 8 | 30 |
| `RubyAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/ruby/mod.rs` | 60 | 23 | 6 | 31 |
| `RustAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/rust/mod.rs` | 72 | 28 | 10 | 34 |
| `ScalaAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/scala/mod.rs` | 73 | 28 | 13 | 32 |
| `TypescriptAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/typescript/mod.rs` | 65 | 26 | 8 | 31 |
| `TreeSitterAnalyzer<A>` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/tree_sitter_analyzer.rs` | 68 | 26 | 16 | 26 |
| `MultiAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/multi_analyzer.rs` | 90 | 29 | 17 | 44 |
| `EmptyAnalyzer` | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/workspace.rs` | 21 | 13 | 0 | 8 |
| `CountingAnalyzer` (test fake) | `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/searchtools/tests.rs` | 23 | 14 | 0 | 9 |
| `NoProviderAnalyzer` (test fake) | `tests/suite_cross_language/structural_search_planner.rs` | 18 | 10 | 0 | 8 |

Totals: 17 implementors, 1018 method bodies, of which 418 are `CodeUnitIndex`, 130 are
`AnalyzerTestHooks`, and 470 stay on `IAnalyzer`.

Census correction found during implementation: there are **seventeen** implementors, not
sixteen. `TreeSitterAnalyzer<A>` implements the trait as
`impl<A> crate::analyzer::IAnalyzer for TreeSitterAnalyzer<A> where A: LanguageAdapter`, a
path-qualified generic form that a `^impl IAnalyzer for` sweep does not match. It is the
one that matters most: every language analyzer's split half forwards to it, so it holds
the real implementations the twelve wrappers delegate to.

The two production non-language implementors the plan called out are both present
(`MultiAnalyzer`, `EmptyAnalyzer`). The test-fake sweep found exactly two
(`CountingAnalyzer`, `NoProviderAnalyzer`); neither overrides a `*_for_test` hook, so both
inherit the no-op `test_hooks()` default. There is no fake in `bifrost-lsp`,
`bifrost-mcp`, `bifrost-runtime`, `bifrost-policy` or `bifrost-nlp`: those crates consume
analyzers built by `WorkspaceAnalyzer`, never hand-rolled ones.

## 2. `CodeUnitIndex` membership

Decision 4's semantic definition: the read-only index over a project's declarations --
enumerating them, resolving names to them, rendering their sources, skeletons and
signatures, and navigating parent/child structure. Signature closure over core types is
the mechanical check, not the definition.

Forty-one methods qualify. Every one of them has a signature closed over
`brokk-bifrost-core` types already (`CodeUnit`, `ProjectFile`, `Language`, `Range`,
`SignatureMetadata`, `SummaryFileProjection`, `Project`, `CancellationToken`, plain
strings and std collections), so the check is satisfied with **zero type moves and zero
new core dependencies**.

Enumerating (14): `project`, `languages`, `analyzed_files`, `get_analyzed_files`,
`is_analyzed`, `is_empty`, `top_level_declarations`, `get_top_level_declarations`,
`declarations`, `get_declarations`, `all_declarations`, `get_all_declarations`,
`all_declarations_with_primary_ranges`, `summary_file_projection`.

Resolving names (7): `definitions`, `get_definitions`, `lookup_candidates_by_short_name`,
`lookup_candidates_by_identifier`, `search_definitions`, `search_definitions_with_literal`,
`search_definitions_persisted`.

Rendering (15): `ranges`, `ranges_of`, `ranges_with_limit`, `get_skeleton`,
`get_skeleton_header`, `get_skeletons`, `get_source`, `get_sources`, `signatures`,
`signatures_of`, `signature_metadata`, `signature_metadata_of`, `indexed_source`,
`indexed_source_matches`, `render_source_fragment`.

Navigating (5): `direct_children`, `get_direct_children`, `direct_children_in_file`,
`get_members_in_class`, `parent_of`.

One free function moves with them: `default_parent_fq_name` (`parent_of`'s default body).
It reads `CodeUnit::fq`, `fq_name::segment_interner` and `common::language_for_file`, all
three already in core.

## 3. Candidates rejected, and why

These were examined under the same definition and left on `IAnalyzer`. The first group
fails the mechanical check; the second passes it but fails the definition; the third is
the search adjudication (section 4).

### 3.1 Signature or default body drags a non-core type

| Method | Non-core type | What moving it would add to core |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `begin_query`, `end_query` | `AnalyzerQueryContext` | owns `store::StoreError`: the whole persisted-store error model |
| `workspace_file_index_cell` | `WorkspaceFileIndexCell`, `WorkspaceFileIndex` | request-scope machinery, not index reads; also lifecycle, see 3.2 |
| `global_usage_definition_index` | `DefinitionIndexHandle<'_>`, `GlobalUsageDefinitionIndex` | the usages resolution model (`analyzer/global_usage_definition_index.rs`) |
| `usage_facts_index` | `UsageFactsIndex` | the usages framework |
| `snapshot_caches` | `AnalyzerSnapshotCaches` | structural derived layers + workspace usage-graph cache + semantic model runtime cache, i.e. `moka` and the semantic engine |
| `semantic_model_overlay` | `SemanticModelOverlay` | the semantic model layer |
| `structural_search_providers` | `structural::StructuralSearchProvider` | the structural search engine |
| `import_analysis_provider`, `import_analysis_provider_for_file`, `type_hierarchy_provider`, `type_alias_provider`, `test_detection_provider` | `ImportAnalysisProvider`, `TypeHierarchyProvider`, `TypeAliasProvider`, `TestDetectionProvider` | nothing after commit 3 (`capabilities.rs` moves to core), but these are capability accessors, not index reads -- decision 4 keeps every provider accessor on `IAnalyzer` |
| `comment_density`, `comment_density_by_fq_name`, `comment_density_by_top_level` | default bodies call `analyzer::comment_density` | the tree-sitter comment scanner |
| `find_exception_handling_smells` | default body calls `analyzer::exception_handling` | the per-language exception model |
| `find_test_assertion_smells*`, `find_structural_clone_smells*`, `compute_cognitive_complexities` | `TestAssertionAnalysis` etc. are core, but the implementations are grammar-backed smells | -- (definition failure, see 3.2) |
| `find_usages`, `query_usages` | `FuzzyResult`, `QueryResult`, `UsageFinder` | the usages framework |
| `update`, `update_all`, `as_capability` | `Self: Sized` | not object-safe; assembly-layer construction |
| `list_symbols`, `list_top_level_symbols`, `list_symbols_with_types` | signature is core-typed (`BTreeSet<CodeUnitType>`), but the shared renderer calls `common::display_identifier_for_target` -> `display_symbol_name` -> `analyzer::languages::language_support` | the entire milestone-1 language SPI. This is the sharpest instance of decision 4's "resolve per-method": rendering a symbol *listing* is arguably index rendering, but its display names are a per-language capability, so the method stays. |

### 3.2 Core-typed but outside the definition

* Syntax/parse-tree queries, not declaration-index reads: `parse_errors`,
  `semantic_diagnostics`, `declaration_syntax_kind`, `is_access_expression`,
  `find_nearest_declaration`, `extract_call_receiver`. These are the closest calls in
  the whole inventory, and one of them did not survive re-examination:
  `enclosing_code_unit` and `enclosing_code_unit_for_lines` were listed here on
  2026-08-04 and moved to `CodeUnitIndex` on 2026-08-05, see the decision log.
* Import facts, not declarations: `import_statements`, `import_statements_of`.
* Test classification: `contains_tests`, `in_test_region`, `file_is_test_only`,
  `get_test_modules`, `test_files_to_code_units`.
* Aggregate reports and projections over the index rather than access to it: `metrics`
  (`metrics_from_declarations` is already in core, so this one is a pure definition call),
  `get_symbols`.
* Lifecycle, not reads: `begin_streaming_file_read`, `end_streaming_file_read`,
  `release_streaming_readers`, `warm_query_indexes`, `query_indexes_warm`,
  `snapshot_source_generations`, `snapshot_generations_match`.

## 4. Search-method adjudication

The plan offers three options: move `SearchSymbolPatternBatch` / `QueryBatch` /
`SearchSymbolCandidates` plus `regex` into core; redesign the signatures around
core-owned request data; or leave the methods on `IAnalyzer`.

Findings from the sweep:

* `SearchSymbolPatternBatch` (`i_analyzer.rs:68`) owns `CompiledSymbolPatterns`, which is
  a `RegexSet` or a `Vec<Regex>`. `brokk-bifrost-core` has no `regex` dependency.
* Exactly **one** trait method mentions any of the batch types:
  `search_symbol_candidates(&self, patterns: &SearchSymbolPatternBatch, cancellation:
  Option<&CancellationToken>) -> SearchSymbolCandidates`. `QueryBatch` and
  `SearchSymbolCandidates` appear nowhere else in the trait.
* The other five search/lookup entry points -- `search_definitions(&str, bool)`,
  `search_definitions_with_literal(&str, &str, Language)`,
  `search_definitions_persisted(&str)`, `lookup_candidates_by_short_name(&str)`,
  `lookup_candidates_by_identifier(&str)` -- take plain strings and return
  `BTreeSet<CodeUnit>`. Their *implementations* compile regexes; their *signatures* do not
  name a regex type.
* `autocomplete_definitions(&str) -> Vec<CodeUnit>` also has a core-typed signature, but
  its default body calls `regex::escape` to build the fuzzy camelCase pattern.

**Decision: split at the compiled-request boundary.** The five plain-string lookups move
to `CodeUnitIndex`; `search_symbol_candidates` and `autocomplete_definitions` stay on
`IAnalyzer`.

Reasons:

1. The batch types are cleanly separable -- one method mentions them -- so keeping the
   plain-string lookups on `IAnalyzer` would be keeping them there for a dependency they
   do not have.
2. Name resolution is explicitly half of decision 4's definition, and
   `lookup_candidates_by_identifier` is nothing but name resolution. Excluding it would
   make `CodeUnitIndex` a trait that can enumerate and render declarations but not look
   one up by name, which is the arbitrary-feeling outcome the plan tells us to stop for.
3. The stated criterion is legible: a method belongs to the index if its *request* is
   core-owned data. A pattern string is; a pre-compiled `RegexSet` is not. That criterion
   also decides `autocomplete_definitions` without a special case -- its default body
   compiles a pattern, so it is a compiled-request method wearing a string signature.
4. Moving `regex` into core was rejected. It would be a real dependency addition to the
   crate whose whole purpose (#1549) is to sit at the bottom of the graph and rebuild
   fast, bought for one method. Redesigning `SearchSymbolPatternBatch` around core-owned
   request data was rejected too: pre-compiling once per request and sharing the compiled
   set across every delegate is exactly the point of the type (#1199 bounded symbol
   search), and un-compiling it would regress that.

Consequence for consumers: a holder of `&dyn CodeUnitIndex` can resolve names and
substring-search declarations, but cannot run a batched multi-pattern symbol search. That
is the intended tier boundary, not an oversight.

## 5. `*_for_test` hooks

Twenty-one hook methods are declared on `IAnalyzer` today, none of them `cfg`-gated --
they are plain `#[doc(hidden)]` methods with no-op / `0` defaults:

`reset_global_usage_definition_index_build_count_for_test`,
`global_usage_definition_index_build_count_for_test`,
`reset_definition_candidates_query_count_for_test`,
`definition_candidates_query_count_for_test`,
`reset_full_declaration_scan_count_for_test`, `full_declaration_scan_count_for_test`,
`reset_search_candidate_hydration_count_for_test`,
`search_candidate_hydration_count_for_test`,
`reset_package_declaration_scan_count_for_test`,
`package_declaration_scan_count_for_test`, `reset_candidate_hydration_count_for_test`,
`candidate_hydration_count_for_test`, `full_candidate_hydration_count_for_test`,
`bulk_candidate_hydration_count_for_test`, `reset_workspace_path_scan_count_for_test`,
`workspace_path_scan_count_for_test`,
`reset_scala_project_types_build_count_for_test`,
`scala_project_types_build_count_for_test`, `reset_scala_query_scan_counts_for_test`,
`scala_query_parse_count_for_test`, `scala_query_walk_count_for_test`.

The last five are the Scala-specific group (the plan's "two Scala-specific ones" is a
count of the two counter *families*: the project-types build counter and the query
scan-count pair with its shared reset).

114 overrides across 13 implementors. `MultiAnalyzer` overrides 17 of the 21 and is the
only aggregating implementor: its bodies fan out over `self.delegates()` and `sum()` /
fold, so its hooks object has to be `self` rather than a delegate's.

### Call sites outside the analyzers

Trait hooks only. Several of these files also call `*_for_test` names that are inherent
methods on a concrete analyzer or free functions (`full_hydration_count_for_test`,
`definition_query_count_for_test`, `scala_active_path_node_visits_for_test`,
`rust_tree_parse_count_for_test`, ...); those are untouched by the quarantine.

| File | Hooks used |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/analyzer_persistence.rs` | the full set (75 references) |
| `tests/issue_1194_csharp_scan_complexity.rs` | `package_declaration_scan_count` |
| `tests/issue_1199_search_symbols_latency.rs` | `search_candidate_hydration_count` |
| `tests/suite_usages/usages_csharp_graph_test.rs` | candidate hydration, full-declaration scan |
| `tests/suite_usages/usages_scala_graph_test.rs`, `tests/suite_usages/usages_java_graph_test.rs` | scala query scan counts, full-declaration scan |
| `tests/suite_symbols/get_definition_test.rs`, `tests/suite_symbols/searchtools_fuzzy_symbol_lookup.rs` | definition-candidates query, candidate hydration |
| `tests/suite_cross_language/code_query_pipelines.rs` | full-declaration scan |
| `tests/suite_analyzers/scala_type_hierarchy_test.rs`, `tests/suite_analyzers/cpp_type_hierarchy_test.rs` | scala project-types build, full-declaration scan |
| `tests/suite_smells/scala_dead_code_smells.rs` | scala query scan counts |
| `tests/suite_issues/issue_1230_rust_scan_complexity.rs`, `tests/suite_issues/issue_1332_search_notes_honesty.rs` | full-declaration scan, search-candidate hydration |
| `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/code_quality/git_hotspots.rs` (cfg(test)) | definition-candidates query |
| `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/searchtools/summaries.rs` (cfg(test)) | package-declaration scan |
| `crates/bifrost-analysis/src/analyzer/usages/get_definition/{mod,ruby,scala}.rs` (cfg(test)) | definition-candidates query |
| `crates/bifrost-nlp/src/chunker.rs` (cfg(test)) | package-declaration scan, candidate hydration |
| `crates/bifrost-mcp/src/searchtools_service.rs` (cfg(test)) | global usage definition index build |

Correction to the plan's acceptance wording: of the three suites it names as examples,
only `issue_1194` calls an `IAnalyzer` trait hook. `issue_1175_scan_usages_reparse.rs`
uses `prepared_syntax_parse_count_for_test`, an inherent method on the concrete analyzer,
and `issue_1219_location_scan_target.rs` uses the free functions
`rust_tree_parse_count_for_test` and friends. Neither is affected by the quarantine;
both still have to keep compiling and passing, which is what the acceptance is really
asking for.

`brokk-bifrost-nlp` and `brokk-bifrost-mcp` already carry
`brokk-bifrost-analysis = { ..., features = ["test-support"] }` in their
`[dev-dependencies]`, as does the root manifest, so the feature gate reaches every call
site listed above without a manifest change.

### Quarantine shape

```rust
#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))]
fn test_hooks(&self) -> &dyn AnalyzerTestHooks { &NoOpAnalyzerTestHooks }
```

`AnalyzerTestHooks` carries the 21 methods with today's no-op / `0` defaults and lives in
`analyzer/i_analyzer.rs`, so nothing test-shaped reaches `brokk-bifrost-core`. Every
implementor that overrides a hook gets
`impl AnalyzerTestHooks for X` plus `fn test_hooks(&self) -> &dyn AnalyzerTestHooks { self }`.

The accessor keeps a default body (returning a `&'static` ZST whose methods are the
existing defaults) rather than being a required method. That is exactly today's
behavior for the three implementors that override no hook, and it keeps `EmptyAnalyzer`
and both test fakes untouched. The quarantine is the `cfg` gate, not the absence of a
default; decision 4's rejection of an "unconditional default-no-op supertrait" is about a
*supertrait*, which this is not.

## 6. `capabilities.rs` / `pool_memo.rs` move (commit 3)

Bounds to rewrite: `TypeHierarchyProvider::get_polymorphic_matches<T: IAnalyzer>` (calls
`analyzer.parent_of`) and `build_direct_descendant_index<A: IAnalyzer, P>` (calls
`analyzer.all_declarations`). Both close over `CodeUnitIndex` methods only.

Dependencies the move adds to `brokk-bifrost-core`:

* `rayon` -- `pool_memo.rs` calls `rayon::current_thread_index()` and
  `capabilities.rs::build_reverse_file_index` uses `par_iter`. Already a workspace
  dependency at 1.10.0 and already in the published graph via the facade and analysis, so
  it adds no new third-party crate to the license inventory.

Everything else `capabilities.rs` names is already in core: `CodeUnit`, `ProjectFile`,
`ImportInfo` (`core/analyzer/model.rs:2604`), `compact_graph::{CompactRows,
CompactRowsBuilder}`, `hash::{HashMap, HashSet}`.

`PoolSafeMemo::get` keeps its `#[cfg(test)]` gate verbatim.

## 7. Decision log

* 2026-08-04: `CodeUnitIndex` gets `Send + Sync` as supertraits, mirroring what
  `IAnalyzer` already guaranteed, so no existing generic bound weakens.
* 2026-08-04: search adjudication as recorded in section 4 -- the five plain-string
  lookups move, `search_symbol_candidates` and `autocomplete_definitions` stay, `regex`
  does not enter core.
* 2026-08-04: `list_symbols` / `list_top_level_symbols` / `list_symbols_with_types` stay
  on `IAnalyzer` despite core-typed signatures. Their renderer resolves display names
  through `analyzer::languages::language_support`; per decision 4 the resolution is "the
  method does not belong on the index", not "move the type", because what it depends on
  is the milestone-1 language SPI, not a misplaced model type.
* 2026-08-04: `metrics` stays despite `metrics_from_declarations` already being in core:
  an aggregate report over the index is not access to it.
* 2026-08-04: the location-to-declaration group (`enclosing_code_unit`,
  `enclosing_code_unit_for_lines`, `is_access_expression`, `find_nearest_declaration`,
  `declaration_syntax_kind`) stays. Core-typed signatures, but they answer from a parse
  tree, and decision 4's definition names four operations that do not include location
  lookup.
* 2026-08-04: no analysis-side type had to move into core to satisfy the membership set.
  The one dependency the milestone adds to core is `rayon`, and it arrives with
  `pool_memo.rs`/`capabilities.rs` in commit 3, not with the trait split.
* 2026-08-04 (during the split): seventeenth implementor found -- `TreeSitterAnalyzer<A>`,
  see section 1. Nothing about the membership decision changed; the census sweep pattern
  was too narrow.
* 2026-08-04 (during the split): ten inherent `pub fn <hook>_for_test` wrappers on
  `CSharpAnalyzer`, `GoAnalyzer` and `RustAnalyzer` were deleted rather than kept. Each was
  a byte-identical forward to the same-named trait hook, and inherent methods win name
  resolution, so leaving them would have meant a concrete-typed caller silently bypassing
  `test_hooks()` while a `dyn`-typed caller went through it -- the two-copies hazard the
  quarantine exists to end. Their callers now go through `test_hooks()` like everyone else.
* 2026-08-04 (during the split): `TreeSitterAnalyzer`'s `AnalyzerTestHooks` impl gained
  `reset_search_candidate_hydration_count_for_test` and
  `search_candidate_hydration_count_for_test`, which its `IAnalyzer` impl had never
  overridden. They existed only as inherent methods, so `RustAnalyzer`'s forward reached
  them by inherent resolution while any `dyn IAnalyzer` view of a `TreeSitterAnalyzer`
  silently returned `0`. Routing the forward through `test_hooks()` surfaced that gap as a
  failure in `issue_1199_symbol_search_hydration_tracks_matches_not_workspace_size`; the
  fix closes the divergence at its source rather than special-casing the two names.
* 2026-08-04 (during the split): every call site of a trait hook is now
  `<receiver>.test_hooks().<hook>()`. Calling a method on the returned
  `&dyn AnalyzerTestHooks` does not require the trait in scope, so no call site imports
  `AnalyzerTestHooks`; only `IAnalyzer` has to be in scope, for `test_hooks()` itself.
* 2026-08-04 (during the split): the supertrait split costs an import, not a call-site
  rewrite. 121 files across the workspace gained `use ...::CodeUnitIndex;` because Rust
  requires the defining trait in scope even for a supertrait method on `dyn IAnalyzer`, and
  ten analysis files had the import placed inside their `#[cfg(test)]` module because only
  their tests need it. `IAnalyzer::<m>` / `<Self as IAnalyzer>::<m>` qualified calls in 17
  files became `CodeUnitIndex::<m>`. No call expression changed shape.
* 2026-08-05 (reopened): `enclosing_code_unit` and `enclosing_code_unit_for_lines` move
  to `CodeUnitIndex`, reversing the 2026-08-04 entry above. That entry rested on "they
  answer from a parse tree", which is an implementation argument about how
  `TreeSitterAnalyzer` happens to compute the answer, not a semantic one about what the
  operation is. Semantically "which declaration encloses this location" is a query over
  the declaration index: its inputs are a `ProjectFile` and a `Range`, its output is a
  `CodeUnit`, and the real body already answers it by scanning `declarations` and
  `ranges` -- both `CodeUnitIndex` methods -- rather than by walking a syntax tree. The
  Go extraction pilot supplied the cost of getting it wrong: `usages/go_graph/hits.rs`
  attributes every usage hit through `IAnalyzer::enclosing_code_unit`, so with no
  `CodeUnitIndex` equivalent the extractor/hits pair (650 LOC) could not follow Go out of
  analysis, and the same coupling would have repeated for each of the eleven remaining
  languages. Decision 4's four enumerated operations are read as a description of the
  membership test, not an exhaustive list; location-to-declaration lookup is index
  navigation and is now a fifth. `enclosing_code_unit_for_lines` moves with it: identical
  shape (file plus location in, `Option<CodeUnit>` out), the same implementors implement
  the pair identically, and a language scan calls it (`kotlin/diagnostics.rs`).
  `is_access_expression`, `find_nearest_declaration` and `declaration_syntax_kind` stay:
  they were listed as siblings but share neither the shape (a syntax predicate, a
  `DeclarationInfo`, a tree-sitter node kind) nor a language-scan caller, and moving them
  would be speculative. Both moved methods stay required (no default), as they were on
  `IAnalyzer`; all 17 implementors relocate their existing body from the `IAnalyzer` impl
  block to the `CodeUnitIndex` one with no change to the body.
* 2026-08-05: `BoundedDefinitionLookup` lowered to core beside `CodeUnitIndex`
  (`analyzer/definition_lookup.rs`), with `sort_units` (its default bodies' canonical
  ordering). The W3 brief asked for a *new* core-owned bounded-definition-lookup trait
  shaped from `go/diagnostics.rs`'s call sites, which are all
  `!handle.fqn(name).is_empty()`. That trait already existed: `BoundedDefinitionLookup`
  in `global_usage_definition_index.rs`, object-safe, already `&dyn`-consumed by five
  language definition providers, and already implemented for `DefinitionIndexHandle`.
  Defining a second single-method trait next to it would have given
  `DefinitionIndexHandle` two overlapping name-lookup contracts, so the resolution is to
  lower the existing one rather than add a rival. It passes the mechanical check
  unchanged -- every signature is `CodeUnit`/`Language`/`ProjectFile`/`&str`/`bool`, and
  the one helper its defaults need (`rel_path_string`) was already in core. It is not an
  inventory method and does not change section 3.1: `global_usage_definition_index` stays
  on `IAnalyzer` and `DefinitionIndexHandle` stays in analysis, because the *handle* is
  the usages resolution model. What moves is the question, not the index: a language scan
  asking "does the workspace define this fq name" now names a core trait.
* 2026-08-05: `go/diagnostics.rs`'s `GoDiagnosticCollector` holds
  `&dyn BoundedDefinitionLookup` instead of `&'a DefinitionIndexHandle<'a>`. The handle's
  lifetime structure supported this without redesign: the borrow is a plain shared
  reference and the trait has no lifetime-bearing method, so `&DefinitionIndexHandle<'_>`
  unsizes at the call site with no signature change. The collector no longer names an
  analysis type; the file's remaining analysis dependencies are `IAnalyzer` /
  `resolve_analyzer::<GoAnalyzer>`, `tree_sitter_analyzer::collect_parse_errors`, and
  `usages::go_graph`, which are W1/W4's to move.
