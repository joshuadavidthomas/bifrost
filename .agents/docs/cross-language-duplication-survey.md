# Cross-language duplication survey (2026-07-24)

Purpose: ranked backlog of duplication across the 11 language handlers that could be
**better expressed as shared logic plus per-language plugins/extensions**. The mandate
is explicitly NOT "zero copies": a candidate is accepted only when (1) an invariant
must stay in sync across copies (drift = bug class we keep fixing), (2) the plug
surface is small and stable (mass-per-hole test), and (3) it reduces the marginal
cost of the next language or the next policy change. Candidates failing the test are
recorded as "leave as copies" so they are not relitigated.

Evidence arms:
- **CPD** (PMD 7.14, rust lexer, 80-token floor, baseline + ignore-identifiers lanes)
  over `src/analyzer` + `src/searchtools`. Raw reports:
  `cpd-baseline.xml` / `cpd-anon.xml` (session scratch; re-run with
  `pmd cpd --minimum-tokens 80 --language rust --dir src/analyzer --dir src/searchtools`).
  3 files skipped by the lexer (raw-string edge): bounded_output.rs, php/aliases.rs,
  rust/cargo_routes.rs.
- **Concern-axis agent survey**: six read-only surveys (node-text extraction,
  same-owner classification, import binders, boundary-claim emission, traversal
  work-stacks, enclosing-owner resolution), each producing a per-language matrix and
  an identical / parameterizable / intentionally-divergent classification.

## CPD headline (mechanical arm)

- 717 cross-language-handler duplications, ~95.5k duplicated tokens (80-token floor).
- Top clones are exact-token (identifier-identical) — the handlers are literally
  copy-pasted at the top of the distribution; anonymization adds little up there.
- Dominant families:
  1. **semantic/CFG layer**: `{csharp,python,go,php,scala,rust}/semantic.rs` and
     `{java,js_ts}/semantic/control.rs` share 1.5–3.4k tokens pairwise; largest
     single clone 601 tok / 90 ln (csharp/semantic.rs:2261 ↔ java/semantic/control.rs:1072).
     Freshest duplication in the tree (actively developed layer).
  2. **Adapter `mod.rs` boilerplate**: one 414-token run identical across FOUR
     languages (cpp/mod.rs:390, javascript/mod.rs:543, python/mod.rs:684,
     scala/mod.rs:681); 350–516-token pairwise runs across most `{lang}/mod.rs`.
  3. javascript/mod.rs ↔ typescript/mod.rs: 3.4k tokens — likely intentional
     twin-ness; extraction question is "one js_ts adapter parameterized by dialect",
     to be judged by the mandate, not by mass.
- Same-language cross-file: 53 duplications (smaller helpers surface at a 40-token
  floor, e.g. rust graph_support ↔ usage_index runs).

## Concern 1: node-text extraction & identifier normalization (survey complete)

**Verdict: EXTRACT (strong accept).** Invariant-bearing (sigil normalization must
agree across surfaces), tiny plug surface (identifier-kind set + optional sigil
prefix per language), and it closes a live inconsistency.

- ~30+ private copies of the slice→(trim?)→(ident-normalize?) shape, ~200 LOC:
  - 7 byte-identical Rust-lane copies (declarations.rs:22, graph_support.rs:1516,
    lexical_scope.rs:836, get_definition/rust.rs:5226, rust_graph/{hits.rs:395,
    inverted.rs:776, extractor.rs:3065}).
  - 10 plain-slice Group-A declaration helpers (java/python/go/cpp/php/ruby/scala/
    csharp/js_ts).
  - 8–11 byte-identical `nonempty_node_text` copies in the semantic lowering family
    (rust/php/python/go/cpp/csharp/java/js_ts semantic files) — separate one-line win
    in `semantic/lowering.rs`.
- **Latent bug found**: C# strips verbatim-identifier `@` in declarations
  (csharp/declarations.rs:918) and graph extractor (csharp_graph/extractor.rs:315)
  but NOT in the get_definition path — the same inconsistency class #1128 fixed for
  Rust `r#`. PHP `$` is stripped unconditionally at 10+ call sites (one as a byte
  offset: php_graph/extractor.rs:803) instead of kind-gated in a helper.
- Proposed shape: `node_ident_text(node, source, opts{trim})` with per-language hooks
  `is_identifier_kind(kind)` + `IDENT_PREFIX: Option<&str>` ("r#", "@", "$"),
  following the existing common.rs precedent (`rust_identifier_like_node_kind`,
  `strip_raw_identifier_prefix`).
- **Risks (from survey, must be honored in the ExecPlan):**
  - Trim is load-bearing on the usages side (compound spans) and absent on the
    declaration side — keep as an option, do not force one policy; Ruby and Go each
    have same-name helpers with DIFFERENT trim behavior today (reconcile deliberately).
  - PHP `$` gating must be variable-position-aware — a blanket strip can corrupt
    non-variable spans; highest-risk item.
  - C# `@` strip must not touch attributes or `@"..."` verbatim strings.
  - Standardizing on `get(..).unwrap_or("")` changes PHP/Scala panicking slicers to
    empty-string on bad ranges (desirable, but check for tests relying on panic).
  - Group E `utf8_text()` call sites get UTF-8 validation for free; unifying drops it.

## Concern 2: same-owner / self-receiver classification (survey complete)

**Verdict: EXTRACT (strongest accept in the survey).** ~80% of each per-language
implementation is identical policy; the per-language proof reduces to one boolean.
This is also the extraction that makes #1138 a one-time fix instead of 8 more
transcriptions.

- The policy spine is ALREADY shared (UsageHitKind::SelfReceiver,
  into_self_receiver, included_in exclusion, scan_usages partitioning,
  reclassify_self_receiver_hit_at in usages/common.rs:84 — java/php already route
  through it, proving the layer works). What's duplicated: 9 per-language deciders
  + 6 hand-rolled record-ceremony bodies (~30 LOC each, go/csharp/ruby/python) +
  the repeated self-definition guard.
- Proposed shape: `SameOwnerReceiverProof` trait — per-language boolean
  "does this receiver denote the enclosing instance/own type", consumed by two
  shared consumers (scan classification; inverted routing whose contract is
  proof → record_unproven else record). ~250 LOC of existing copies + ~350-400 LOC
  of not-yet-written #1138 copies avoided.
- **Latent misalignments found (dead-code semantics, per-language):**
  - cpp (inverted.rs:476) and js_ts (inverted.rs:1277,1306) DROP same-owner edges
    entirely (neither java's record_unproven nor proven) — self-only-called methods
    have zero inbound edges.
  - rust's correct behavior is ACCIDENTAL: no explicit self branch; `self` just
    never seeds receiver_type(), falling through to record_unproven.
  - python/go/php/ruby/csharp record same-owner as PROVEN (confidently-alive bias).
- **Load-bearing constraints (must be honored):**
  - Ordering: csharp scan-side widening (bare implicit-this) is GATED on its
    inverted routing landing first (the #1014 regression proved this); a shared
    rollout must sequence inverted-before-scan per language.
  - Own-type-static rules are genuinely per-language (java yes, php self::/static::
    but not parent::, csharp not yet) — they live in the proof, not the policy.
    super/parent/base uniformly external — that IS shareable.
  - go's proof is stateful (SELF_RECEIVER_TOKEN seeding exists only in the scan
    context; inverted needs the seeding ported first). scala returns false honestly
    (graph-shape change, not a hook impl — out of scope, per #1138).
  - csharp bare method-group references stay external (delegate capture is real
    usage) — the hook must not flatten that.

## Concern 3: import binders (survey complete)

**Verdict: SPLIT.** No universal binder core — forcing one would be a
union-of-everything god-struct (fails the mass-per-hole test). But three small
extractions inside it are strong accepts.

- Two families exist today: shared `ImportBinder`/`ImportBinding`/`ImportKind`
  (usages/model.rs:474-503) used by exactly rust, python, js_ts; everything else
  bespoke (go: `(HashMap<String,Vec<String>>, dot-imports)`; csharp: three maps;
  php: `PhpUseAliases` three kind-partitioned maps; java: eager `HashMap→CodeUnit`;
  scala: no stored map at all — ordered candidate-tier search; cpp: 11-field
  `OrdinaryTypeImport` with preprocessor-guard activation; ruby: no imports —
  require/Zeitwerk file+constant conventions).
- **Leave as copies (divergence is the design): scala, cpp, ruby.** Tier-search is
  not a lookup; using-directives are scope-ordered and guard-gated; ruby has nothing
  to bind. java is a false friend (binding fused with resolution to CodeUnit).
- **Optional medium-payoff, judged 2026-07-24: RESOLVED: LEAVE AS COPIES** (go, php,
  csharp do not join the shared `ImportBinder`/`ImportBinding`/`ImportKind` core).
  Full arithmetic below; one real bug found and fixed in the same pass (does not
  require the widening).
  - **(a) Consumer unification is mostly illusory.** Go's bulk usage-graph path
    (`go_graph/resolver.rs::import_binder_of`) is **already on the shared core** —
    it isn't a widening candidate at all, it's an existing user. Its query-time
    sibling (`go/imports.rs::definition_import_namespaces`, feeding
    `get_definition/go.rs`) stays bespoke because it answers a different question
    under a different constraint (single-file, no-workspace-graph, ambiguity-
    preserving `HashMap<alias, Vec<package>>`) and its primary consumer
    (`go_import_paths`) already collapses the `Vec` to `.next()` — the only
    genuine multi-*value* need is dot-imports, which are already a `Vec<String>`
    today with no model change required. PHP's usage-graph consumers
    (`php_graph/extractor.rs`) don't consume a binder at all — they resolve
    FQN-by-FQN via `resolve_php_type/function/constant(text, ctx) == target_fq`
    forward comparison, a different algorithm shape than the Named/Namespace/Glob
    dispatch rust/python/js_ts run over `binder.bindings`; a partition-tagged
    `ImportBinding` would still leave that comparison loop untouched. C#'s
    `visible_type_candidates_with_lookups` is an ordered tiered-candidate search
    (alias → `global::` qualifier → current-namespace probe → using-namespace
    list) — the same species as scala's already-LEFT tier search, not a keyed
    lookup; `namespace_of_file` (the file's own declared namespace) isn't an
    import fact at all and wouldn't fit inside `ImportBinding` regardless of
    widening.
  - **(b) Widening cost lands on the three languages already accepted.** Adding a
    multi-target `Vec` and a namespace-partition tag would add a vestigial
    field/variant to every `ImportKind` match arm across rust (graph_support.rs,
    hierarchy.rs, declarations.rs, lexical_scope.rs), python (mod.rs,
    usage_index.rs, python_graph/{resolver,inverted,extractor}.rs), and js_ts
    (syntax.rs, hierarchy.rs, js_ts_graph/{resolver,inverted,extractor,
    receiver_analysis}.rs) — dozens of sites that would carry `None`/single-
    element handling for a case they never produce. That is the god-struct tax
    the verdict already predicted.
  - **(c) Invariant drift: none found from bespoke-copy divergence** (consistent
    with #1089 being a rust binder gap, not cross-language drift, per the
    original survey). But the arithmetic surfaced a **real, unrelated bug** in
    Go's existing (already-shared-core) participation: `import_binder_of` keyed
    every dot-import (`import . "pkg"`) under one fixed `"*"` map entry, so a
    second dot-import of a different package in the same file silently clobbered
    the first — usages of its exports went unfound. Confirmed with a probe test
    (two dot-imports, disjoint exported names: the first package's usage came
    back `Ok({})`). Root cause is a local keying bug, not a shape the shared model
    lacks — Rust's own glob handling in the same core (`lexical_scope.rs:29-37`)
    already keys by `format!("*:{module}")` for exactly this reason. **Fixed**
    by keying Go's dot-import bindings the same way
    (`usages/go_graph/resolver.rs`); regression test added
    (`go_graph_strategy_resolves_usages_from_multiple_dot_imports_in_one_file`,
    `tests/usages_go_graph_test.rs`). This is a narrow correctness fix inside the
    existing shared core, not evidence for the widening — it fixes a bug in a
    language that was already using the model correctly-shaped, just incorrectly
    keyed.
  - **(d) Marginal cost for language N+1 does not improve.** Widening buys future
    languages a multi-target value and a partition tag, but a hypothetical
    language needing C#'s tiered-search resolution or PHP's three-namespace
    forward-comparison would still write its own consumer logic against the
    widened shape — the mass that would actually be reused (tier search order,
    FQN forward-comparison, budget-limited/`LimitedQueryRows` construction that
    neither the shared core nor its three current consumers have ever needed)
    is exactly the part that stays bespoke either way.
  - **Explicitly added to "leave as copies" list**: go's query-time
    `definition_import_namespaces`, csharp's three using-maps, and PHP's
    `PhpUseAliases` all stay bespoke. Only the already-accepted small wins
    (workspace-boundary predicate, `ImportInfo::local_name()`,
    `StructuredImportPath::render_segments`) and the dot-import keying fix above
    apply to these three languages.
- **ACCEPT (small, high-confidence):**
  1. **Shared workspace-boundary predicate** — the #1126/#1089 honest-claim invariant
     is independently implemented 5×: go_import_path_is_workspace (go.rs:788),
     rust_focused_is_workspace_module_namespace (rust.rs:5326),
     php_workspace_exact_namespace_exists (php.rs:959), scala package_exists use
     (scala.rs:716), csharp workspace_namespace_exists (csharp.rs:121) — same
     decision, same comment wording, five codebases. A shared
     `is_workspace_member(prefix)` + `namespace_or_boundary_outcome` helper makes
     the invariant structural. (Feeds Concern 4.)
  2. **`ImportInfo::local_name()`** — the `alias ?? identifier ?? tail-of-path`
     desugar is copied ~8× (rust lexical_scope.rs:49-66, python mod.rs:471, js_ts,
     csharp imports.rs:316, php, go...). One method on the shared ImportInfo model.
  3. **`StructuredImportPath::render_segments(sep)`** — go get_definition/go.rs:765-786
     and scala segment joins reimplement path rendering over the same model type.

## Concern 4: boundary-claim emission (survey complete)

**Verdict: EXTRACT — and this one is a correctness project wearing a refactoring
coat.** 50 confident-boundary emission sites across 10 languages, ~10 distinct
ad-hoc guard mechanisms, invariant enforced by convention only.

- All confident external claims already route through one shared `boundary()`
  helper (get_definition/mod.rs:1289 + the load-bearing message rewrite at :1297).
  What's NOT shared is the gate: `if external-signal && !workspace-internal
  { boundary } else { no_definition }` is fused ad hoc per site.
- **Latent #1126-class bugs found (unguarded confident claims), ranked:**
  1. python.rs:1225,1285 — import-binding boundary fires with NO workspace-module
     check at all (highest risk; the fqn/module paths at 1821/1841 are guarded,
     the import-binding paths aren't).
  2. rust.rs:1022 — pure text heuristic (`rust_reference_looks_external`), no
     enclosing-scope fallback on this branch (unlike siblings 974/2576/2725).
  3. rust.rs:1441 (macros) — only BoundButUnindexed site without the fallback.
  4. cpp.rs:2107,2402 — `cpp_unresolved_include_boundary` is file-coarse (ANY
     unresolved include + looks-external), not symbol-specific.
  5. csharp.rs:684 — static-using check not tied to the specific member.
  6. js_ts.rs:676 — a relative-path typo becomes a confident boundary claim.
  7. scala.rs:5647 — emits before the lexical-namespace probe (asymmetric w/ 5685).
- **Key design insight: two guard families answer DIFFERENT questions** —
  workspace-namespace existence (go/java/php) catches the #1089 shape;
  enclosing-scope member fallback (rust/cpp) catches the #1126 shape. Languages
  implementing only one are exposed to the other's failure mode; python's
  import-binding path has neither. The gate must take both (OR).
- Proposed shape: `gated_boundary(external_signal, workspace_internal_closure,
  boundary_msg, no_def_kind, no_def_msg)` in mod.rs, making it impossible to emit
  `boundary()` without supplying a workspace-internal check; plus a parameterized
  `enclosing_scope_member_fallback` (5 hand-rolled versions today: rust 5309, cpp's
  resolve_in_enclosing_scopes calls, csharp 2869/1831, java nested-type, scala
  exact-owner) — which also gives Ruby (currently zero boundary claims, misses are
  indistinguishable from external) a safe path to ever emit one.
- Message-template consolidation: ~18 near-identical "appears to cross a {LANG}
  {import|include|using} boundary" strings + 10 verbatim scala copies; risk —
  message text is load-bearing (mod.rs rewrite, downstream matching), consolidate
  in lockstep with consumers.

## Ranked backlog (mandate: shared logic + per-language plugs must be BETTER, not
just fewer copies)

**1. Same-owner classification proof hook** (Concern 2). Invariant-bearing, plug =
one boolean per language per context, and it converts the already-tracked #1138
into a single shared-consumer change instead of 8 transcriptions. Sequencing law:
inverted-routing lands before scan-side widening per language (the #1014 C#
regression proved why). Do #1138 AS this extraction — it's the natural pilot.

**2. Boundary-claim gate + shared enclosing-scope member fallback + workspace
predicate** (Concerns 4 + 3.1 + 6.2). Makes the #1126/#1089 invariant structural
and fixes a real latent-bug list in the same motion (python import-binding paths
first). Plug surface: two closures per language.

**3. Node-text / identifier normalization helper** (Concern 1). ~30 copies,
~200 LOC; closes the live C# `@` inconsistency; plugs = identifier-kind set +
sigil prefix. Risks documented (PHP `$` position-awareness, trim policy per lane).

**4. Traversal tier 1** (Concern 5). Promote `walk_tree_iterative` to pub(crate)
(10 frame clones exist due to visibility alone), promote `cpp_subtree_contains`
as the generic `subtree_contains` (~16 copies), add `descendants_of_kind`/
`named_children` (~9 copies). ~350-420 LOC, near-zero design risk.

**5. Owner-chain service** (Concern 6). Generalize
`ResolutionSession::cpp_enclosing_class_chain` (predicate + budget parametric);
fold C#'s line-for-line fork of `resolve_qualified_in_enclosing_scopes` back in.
~230+120 LOC. Hard constraints: trait `parent_of` dispatch, caller-supplied
predicates, budgets thread through, partial-type fan-out.

**6. Small model wins** (Concerns 3 + 5 tier 2). `ImportInfo::local_name()` (~8
copies), `StructuredImportPath::render_segments`, tests/common consolidation of
call_tool/symbol_sources/definition_reference_status (~14 bodies).

**Judge separately (real design work, not backlog items yet):**
- `enumerate_procedures` skeleton + semantic/CFG layer dedup — CPD's #1 family
  (1.5-3.4k tokens pairwise) but it's David's active layer; coordinate, don't
  land under him.
- Shared `ContainerWalk` for declaration visitors (cpp's Container/Node/Siblings
  as seed; 4 typed + 7 tuple-stack languages).
- ~~Extending ImportBinding to admit go/php/csharp (multi-target + partition
  tag).~~ **RESOLVED 2026-07-24: LEAVE AS COPIES** — see Concern 3's "Optional
  medium-payoff" writeup for the full mass-per-hole arithmetic. A real (unrelated)
  Go dot-import keying bug in the existing shared-core usage was found and fixed
  in the same pass.
- javascript/typescript twin adapters (3.4k tokens; twin-ness may be the honest
  expression — needs the mass-per-hole arithmetic).

**Explicitly leave as copies (divergence is the design):** scala/cpp/ruby import
models; AST-walk owner queries (impl targets, out-of-line owners, bounded
pre-index walkers, sub-CodeUnit scopes, ruby lexical stack, go package model);
range/ancestor containment helpers; CFG/ICFG graph walks; policy value walks;
**the typed declaration-visitor work-stacks** (cpp `CppWork::{Container,Node,
Siblings}`, python `PythonWork::{Container,Statement}`, php `PhpWork::{Container,
Node}`, scala `ScalaWork::{CompilationUnit,TemplateBody}`, and the csharp/ruby/java
single-variant equivalents) — a shared `ContainerWalk<Scope>` would own only
~45-50 LOC of stack ceremony against ~30-42 LOC of per-language ceremony each,
carries no cross-copy invariant that drifts (each visitor's substance —
sibling-scope threading, recovery state machines, fragmented-export reparse — is
language-unique), and cannot host scala's heterogeneous `CompilationUnit` payload;
see Concern 5 Tier 3 item 1 for the full mass-per-hole arithmetic.

## Concern 5: traversal work-stacks + test helpers (survey complete)

**Verdict: EXTRACT in tiers** — tier 1 is nearly free, tier 3 is a real refactor to
judge separately. Scale: ~332 hand-rolled work-stack initializations, ~387
`while let Some(pop)` loops; no shared subtree helpers exist outside `usages/`.

- **Tier 1 (ACCEPT, mechanical):**
  1. `walk_tree_iterative` + `TreeWalkAction` (usages/common.rs:118) is already the
     right enter/exit abstraction but is `pub(super)` — TEN frame-walker clones
     exist only because of visibility (4 identical diagnostics ScanFrames in
     js_ts/rust/python/go diagnostics.rs, 4 structured-type frames in
     model.rs/scala/go/csharp declarations, 2 inverted WalkFrames). Promote to
     `pub(crate)` (analyzer/tree_walk.rs), retarget. ~150-200 LOC + 10 enum defs.
  2. `subtree_contains(node, pred)` — ~16 independent bool-DFS copies;
     cpp/identity.rs:203 is already the generic form, promote verbatim. One pair
     (scala contains_repeated_parameter_type) is byte-identical copy-paste.
     ~130-150 LOC.
  3. `descendants_of_kind` / `named_children` — 2 deep + 7 shallow copies (~70 LOC);
     `for_each_descendant` closure walker absorbs a large share of the ~140 inline
     `stack.extend(children)` scans over time (adopt opportunistically, don't sweep).
- **Tier 2 (ACCEPT, small): test-helper consolidation** — call_tool (5 copies),
  symbol_sources (7), definition_reference_status (2), sorted_source_paths — all
  signature-uniform over BuiltInlineTestProject; lift into tests/common/
  (~14 bodies, ~120 LOC). Mirrors existing CLAUDE.md InlineTestProject guidance.
- **Tier 3 (JUDGE SEPARATELY, real design work):**
  1. Shared `ContainerWalk` (Node + resumable Siblings cursor, generic scope
     payload) hosting the 4 typed declaration visitors (cpp/python/php/scala) and
     eventually the 7 tuple-stack languages. Cpp's Container/Node/Siblings is the
     most general seed. ~200+ LOC of dispatch boilerplate, but visit-node bodies
     stay language-specific — mass-per-hole must be computed honestly.
     **RESOLVED: LEAVE AS COPIES (mass-per-hole computed 2026-07-24).** The shared
     skeleton a generic `ContainerWalk<Scope>` would own is ~45-50 LOC total
     (enum + `push_children` + LIFO drain + a generic Siblings-advance hook +
     Visitor trait). The per-language ceremony it replaces is only ~30-42 LOC each
     (cpp ~42, python ~36, php ~29), and it fails all three mandate gates:
     (1) NO cross-copy invariant that drifts — cpp's using-directive
     sibling-threading (#1093 `advance_cpp_siblings` + `visible_using_namespaces`),
     scala's end-ident/dedent recovery-owner state machine, and cpp's #938/#941
     fragmented-export reparse are each language-unique, not a shared invariant
     kept in sync; the LIFO drain is trivially-correct and stable, not a recurring
     bug class. (2) The plug surface is NOT small/uniform: cpp needs a scope-update
     hook + the Siblings variant; scala's `CompilationUnit` variant carries a
     heterogeneous payload (`children: Vec<Node>, index, package, prefixes,
     recovery_owners`) that is a different shape from every other variant's
     `(node, scope)` — it breaks the "generic scope payload" premise and would keep
     its own walk regardless. (3) It does NOT lower the next-language cost: the
     dispatch bodies (the actual mass — cpp `visit_node` ~120 LOC, scala
     `process_compilation_unit` ~170 LOC) push child work onto the stack THEMSELVES
     at ~40 sites, so genericizing forces `&mut Vec<Work<Scope>>` through every
     unchanged dispatch signature — pure churn against the #1093/#938/#941/#1120/
     #1121 canaries for ~50-70 net LOC saved (scala likely can't even participate).
     The genuinely-shared enter/exit walk was already captured by Tier 1
     (`walk_tree_iterative`, `subtree_contains`); the declaration visitors
     deliberately do not use it because each threads a mutating scope and pushes
     heterogeneous work mid-dispatch — which IS the language-specific part.
  2. `enumerate_procedures` skeleton — 10 near-clones in the semantic modules
     (sibling-key dedup, declaration_paths, budget/cancel checks) with
     language-specific frame fields (Go adds three). Highest payoff (~10x skeleton
     LOC) and highest design cost; overlaps the CPD semantic-layer family, so
     coordinate with David's active work there rather than landing under him.
- **Leave as copies:** range/ancestor containment helpers (different shape),
  CFG/ICFG graph walks (not syntax trees), policy value walks, the
  dependency-discovery string worklist.

## Concern 6: enclosing-owner resolution (survey complete)

**Verdict: EXTRACT two narrow services; leave all AST-walk owner queries alone.**

- The duplicated primitive is the indexed Shape-A walk
  (`enclosing_code_unit → while !is_class { parent_of }`): ~10 independent copies
  (~230 LOC) across java/csharp/cpp/scala/php/python/js_ts (matrix in survey).
  The memoized shared version ALREADY EXISTS as
  `ResolutionSession::cpp_enclosing_class_chain` (get_definition/mod.rs:701) —
  generalize (drop cpp_ prefix, caller-supplied predicate) and retarget.
- Shape B (resolve name against enclosing fqn chain) is already shared
  (`resolve_in_enclosing_scopes`/`resolve_qualified_in_enclosing_scopes`,
  mod.rs:162/181; adopted by rust/cpp/scala) — but **C# maintains a line-for-line
  private fork** (resolve_csharp_in_enclosing_scopes, csharp.rs:2869) plus 3
  variants, differing only by a definitions source and a scope_step budget check.
  Fold back by making the shared version budget-parametric.
- Third small win: the "progressively shorter namespace prefixes" idiom
  (csharp resolve_in_enclosing_namespace, cpp namespace components) →
  `namespace_prefixes(fqn)` iterator.
- **Do NOT unify (genuinely semantic):** rust impl-target resolution (owner is the
  impl'd type, not the enclosing unit), cpp out-of-line owner recovery, bounded
  pre-index AST walkers (scala/cpp/rust), sub-CodeUnit function/lambda scopes,
  ruby's traversal-maintained lexical stack, go's package model.
- **Hard constraints for the shared service:** must call trait `analyzer.parent_of`
  (rust and scala override it with OPPOSITE precedence — scala needs
  structural-first for `$` companions); predicate stays caller-supplied
  (cpp skips type aliases, java sometimes skips functions); budgets must thread
  through (java/csharp charge scope_step per hop — silently dropping truncation
  guarantees is a regression); csharp partial types need multi-declaration fan-out.
