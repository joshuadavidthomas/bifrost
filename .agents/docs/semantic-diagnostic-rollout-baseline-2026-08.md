# Semantic diagnostic rollout baseline, August 2026 (#1628)

This is the measured baseline before any decision about default enablement. It
is evidence, not a gate. No latency threshold exists yet: #1628 reserves that
for team review of these numbers.

Unrecognized-symbol diagnostics stay opt-in. Nothing in this document changes a
default.

The campaign procedure for real projects is
`.agents/docs/semantic-diagnostic-rollout-runbook.md`. This document is the
offline in-repo floor that campaign starts from.

## What produced these numbers

Command, once per fixture:

    cargo build --features release-tooling --bin bifrost_benchmark
    ./target/debug/bifrost_benchmark rollout \
        --fixture-id tests/fixtures/<fixture> \
        --fixture-root tests/fixtures/<fixture> \
        --configuration-id default-analyzer-config

The harness is `src/benchmark/semantic_diagnostic_rollout_harness.rs`. It
performs what an LSP session performs:

1. Build the analyzer over the fixture.
2. Select the ecosystems whose languages the workspace analyzes, by the same
   rule the LSP host uses.
3. Activate dependency packs once against a fresh ephemeral catalog. This is
   the cold activation sample.
4. Run one diagnostic request per analyzable file. This is the cold series.
5. Run the same requests again against the same published proof. This is the
   warm series.
6. Build a fresh analyzer generation, which starts with no published proof, and
   re-activate it against the now-populated catalog. This is the warm
   activation sample, and the per-file requests that follow it are the refresh
   series.

The artifact is then aggregated, validated against the #1712 schema, and
rendered. A run that produced an invalid artifact would fail rather than
report.

## Pins

- Bifrost revision: `325a4ea5f30926669839952db121c59b1222cf9a`, clean tree.
- Fixture revision: the same commit. Every fixture is in-repo, so the commit
  that contains the harness also pins the fixture content.
- Configuration: `default-analyzer-config`, that is `AnalyzerConfig::default()`
  with default `DependencyPackLimits` and default `SemanticModelRuntimeLimits`.
  Each run's configuration SHA-256 also covers the selected ecosystems and the
  measured file list, so a fixture that gains a file produces a different
  configuration hash rather than a silently different comparison.
- Active packs: none, on every fixture. Under `AnalyzerConfig::default()` no
  fixture declares dependency evidence a resolver can turn into a pack, so
  every run activates a complete but empty model set. That is the honest state
  of an offline in-repo fixture, and it is why these activation numbers are a
  floor rather than a full-cost measurement.
- Host: Linux 5.15, debug build (`cargo build`, not `--release`). Debug numbers
  overstate wall-clock latency relative to a shipped build. Treat them as
  relative signals across fixtures, not as absolute product latency.
- One run per fixture, no repetition, so there is no variance estimate.

## Activation

| Fixture | Ecosystem | Cold host ms | Warm host ms | Result | Max catalog SQL |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---:|
| `testcode-py` | Python | 0.437 | 0.263 | ready | 0 |
| `testcode-go` | Go | 0.551 | 0.272 | ready | 0 |
| `testcode-java` | Jvm | 15.595 | 18.141 | ready | 0 |
| `testcode-rs` | Cargo | 0.445 | 0.269 | ready | 0 |
| `testcode-ts` | Npm | 0.555 | 0.335 | ready | 0 |
| `testcode-ruby` | Ruby | 0.519 | 0.294 | ready | 0 |
| `testcode-cs` | DotNet | 0.523 | 0.445 | ready | 0 |

Every activation reached `ready`, so every run published proof and requested a
diagnostic refresh.

The JVM row is the only activation costing more than a millisecond, and it does
not improve when warm. Its cost is the default-on metadata discovery walk plus
the `$JAVA_HOME` standard-library probe, neither of which the catalog caches.
Every other ecosystem is sub-millisecond because its resolver finds no evidence
to read under default configuration.

Activation runs on a background worker and never on a request path, so these
numbers bound a background cost, not a user-visible one.

## Diagnostics

Per-file request latency in milliseconds. Cold is the first read of each file;
warm re-reads the same files against the same published proof; refresh is the
first read after a fresh generation re-activates.

| Fixture | Files | Cold p50 | Cold p95 | Warm p50 | Warm p95 | Refresh p50 | Refresh p95 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `testcode-py` | 43 | 1.959 | 5.792 | 0.549 | 2.997 | 1.935 | 5.798 |
| `testcode-go` | 7 | 0.475 | 19.848 | 0.195 | 1.576 | 0.497 | 18.385 |
| `testcode-java` | 26 | 1.374 | 3.852 | 0.304 | 1.385 | 1.367 | 3.797 |
| `testcode-rs` | 2 | 7.756 | 16.058 | 3.438 | 6.718 | 7.058 | 14.993 |
| `testcode-ts` | 21 | 2.512 | 10.043 | 1.536 | 7.091 | 2.569 | 10.007 |
| `testcode-ruby` | 17 | 0.625 | 5.628 | 0.400 | 1.347 | 0.620 | 5.277 |
| `testcode-cs` | 6 | 4.137 | 543.734 | 2.414 | 540.098 | 6.580 | 542.398 |

Every measured request issued zero catalog SQL statements, which is the
invariant that keeps a diagnostic request read-only against the pack catalog.

Read the percentiles with the sample count in view. Nearest-rank p95 over two
to seven samples is the slowest single file, not a distribution.

Three observations to carry into review:

- Warm is consistently two to four times faster than cold, and refresh tracks
  cold rather than warm. This is expected, and it is why cold and warm are
  separate series: a new analyzer generation rebuilds the per-generation
  structures the collectors read, so the first request after any workspace
  update pays cold cost again. Refresh, not cold, is what an editing session
  pays repeatedly.
- `testcode-cs` has one file at roughly 540 ms that does not improve when warm.
  It is the largest single latency in the baseline by two orders of magnitude,
  and it is the first thing to profile before any default-enablement decision.
  It is below the five-second threshold that `CLAUDE.md` makes an automatic
  product-regression report, so no issue is filed here; it is recorded as the
  named follow-up for review.
- `testcode-go` cold p95 of about 19 ms against a p50 of 0.5 ms is one slow
  file out of seven, not a broad cost.

## Correctness signals

| Fixture | Status | Errors per pass | Absent proofs | Suppressions |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| `testcode-py` | incomplete | 19 | 57 | `missing_dependency_discovery` 213 |
| `testcode-go` | incomplete | 0 | 0 | `missing_dependency_discovery` 9 |
| `testcode-java` | complete | 69 | 207 | none |
| `testcode-rs` | incomplete | 0 | 0 | `missing_dependency_discovery` 15, `unsupported_generated_surface` 9 |
| `testcode-ts` | incomplete | 390 | 1170 | `missing_dependency_discovery` 3 |
| `testcode-ruby` | incomplete | 0 | 0 | `missing_dependency_discovery` 12, `unsupported_semantics` 3 |
| `testcode-cs` | incomplete | 0 | 0 | `missing_dependency_discovery` 99, `unsupported_semantics` 15 |

Counts are totals across the three phases, which measure the same files three
times; per-pass error counts are given separately.

`Status: incomplete` is not a failure. It means at least one outcome carried a
typed suppression, which is the proof system working: a name the session cannot
prove absent produces a suppression rather than an error.

Emitted errors always equal the complete-absence proof count, which the
artifact validator enforces. No run published an error without a proof.

`testcode-ts` publishes 390 errors across 21 files and `testcode-java` publishes
69 across 26. Those counts are large because these fixtures are deliberately
full of unresolved references. They are the highest-value input to the
zero-confirmed-false-positive review in the runbook, not a latency concern.

## What this baseline does not establish

- It does not measure a workspace with real dependency packs. Every fixture
  activates an empty model set, so pack decode, hydration, and matcher
  construction are all near zero here. A pinned real-project campaign is
  required before enablement; the runbook describes it.
- It does not measure a release build.
- It does not set or propose a p95 threshold.
- It carries no variance estimate.

## Addendum, 2026-08-08: the `testcode-cs` outlier (#1806)

The numbers above stay as they are. This section records the follow-up the
`testcode-cs` row named, and re-measures that one fixture. Nothing else in this
document changes.

### Which file, and what it was doing

The 540 ms file is `GetTerminationRecordByIdHandler.cs`: 34 lines, four `using`
directives, and a six-segment namespace
(`ConsumerCentricityPermission.Core.Business.Handlers.TerminationRecordHandlers.Queries`).
It is not generated, not large, and has no deep supertype chain. It is the only
file in the fixture with a realistic .NET namespace depth; every sibling sits in
a namespace of zero to three segments.

Section timing inside the collector put the whole cost in one place. Of 536 ms
of tree walk, `visible_type_candidates` accounted for about 450 ms across 19
calls and the local-binding seeder for the remaining 84 ms -- and the seeder
resolves declared types through the same search. The retained assembly index was
never built during the run, so no external path ran at all; the cost was
entirely the workspace-side type search.

That search costs one store query per candidate short name, per namespace it
qualifies the name with. Three things multiplied:

1. **The candidate spellings were exponential.** C# writes type nesting into a
   `short_name` with `$`, so a dotted spelling could be stored several ways.
   `csharp_nested_owner_short_name_candidates` enumerated *every* `.`/`$` mask,
   `2^(n-1)` per candidate, so a seven-segment probe expanded to 127 spellings
   and each became its own SQL query. Since `csharp_normalize_full_name` maps
   `$` back to `.`, all of them normalize to one name: they were alternate
   lookup keys for a single target, and the mixed ones -- a spelling that
   returns to `$` after a `.` -- match nothing the analyzer can persist.
2. **Every namespace was probed whether or not it existed.** The search
   qualified each name with the file's namespace, each `using`, and each
   ancestor namespace: eleven probes for this file. The workspace declares
   nothing in nine of them.
3. **Nothing was reused within a request.** The type-reference ladder, the
   member-owner ladder, the enclosing-type lookup and the supertype walk each
   ran the search independently, so `PermissionTerminationRecord` was searched
   for five times and `BaseClass` in `ClassUsagePatterns.cs` ten times.

Multiplied out, one `Guid` lookup in this file issued about 347 store queries
and the file issued roughly 15,000 per request. Measured cost tracked predicted
query count at about 35 microseconds per query across every identity, which is
why the file did not improve when warm: nothing was being populated, the work
was simply being redone.

### What changed

- `csharp_nested_owner_short_name_candidates` returns one spelling per
  nesting-run length instead of one per separator mask. The result is a subset
  of the old set at every length, so no lookup that could match was dropped.
- The visible-type search skips a qualifying namespace the workspace declares
  nothing in. The `using` case was already filtered on exactly that condition
  after the fact; the file-namespace and ancestor cases are gated only for a
  spelling with no separators of its own, where the qualifier is provably the
  namespace a match would sit in. `CSharpAnalyzer::workspace_namespace_exists`
  is memoized per generation so the gate is not itself a query per probe.
- The C# diagnostic collector answers each spelling's search once per request.

### Re-measured

Same command, same fixture, same `default-analyzer-config`, debug build. The
host was busy (load average 17-19), so before and after were built as two
binaries and run alternately, three runs each, rather than compared against the
pinned numbers above. Milliseconds, median of three:

| File | Cold before | Cold after | Cold | Warm before | Warm after | Warm |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `GetTerminationRecordByIdHandler.cs` | 540.3 | 51.3 | 10.5x | 538.3 | 47.2 | 11.4x |
| `ClassUsagePatterns.cs` | 22.2 | 5.4 | 4.1x | 19.2 | 2.9 | 6.6x |
| `AssetRegistrySA.cs` | 20.8 | 5.7 | 3.6x | 17.9 | 2.7 | 6.6x |
| `MixedScope.cs` | 4.1 | 4.0 | 1.0x | 2.5 | 2.0 | 1.2x |
| `A.cs` | 4.2 | 4.2 | 1.0x | 0.5 | 0.5 | 1.0x |
| `NestedNamespaces.cs` | 1.6 | 1.6 | 1.0x | 0.4 | 0.4 | 1.0x |

The outlier is 10.5x faster cold and 11.4x faster warm. It is no longer two
orders of magnitude above its siblings; it is about ten times the fixture's next
slowest file, and the fixture's other namespace-bearing files improved by three
to seven times as a side effect. The two files that name no type at all are
unchanged, as expected.

Outcomes are identical. Every one of the eighteen samples in all six artifacts
matches on status, emitted errors, proof classes and suppression classes; the
fixture still publishes 51 resolved, 114 incomplete, 99
`missing_dependency_discovery` and 15 `unsupported_semantics`, and zero errors.

### What still costs 47 ms, and why it is not fixed here

Under instrumentation -- which inflates the total, so read these as shares
rather than absolute times -- the remainder splits roughly into four parts:

- **A resolved fq name searched as if it were a written spelling (largest
  share).** For a member access through a local, the binding seeder resolves the
  declared type to a workspace fq name, and the collector then hands that fq
  name back to the *relative* visible-name search. The search dutifully
  qualifies an already-absolute name with the file namespace and each ancestor,
  producing probes like `A.B.C.A.B.C.Type`, and only reaches the absolute
  spelling last. Trying the absolute spelling first would change C#'s
  relative-before-absolute lookup order, which is a proof-semantics change, so
  the fix is to stop discarding what the seeder resolved rather than to reorder
  the ladder. Not attempted here.
- **A non-name expression's source text used as a type spelling.** The receiver
  of `.ConfigureAwait(false)` is an `invocation_expression`;
  `csharp_type_node_identity` falls back to raw node text, so the resolver is
  asked to look up
  `` `_terminationRecordDL.GetByIdAsync(request.TerminationRecordId, new Graph` ``.
  This is the source-text-instead-of-AST pattern `CLAUDE.md` prohibits, and it
  is a guaranteed miss. Fixing it changes the `detail` string of an
  `UnsupportedSemantics` suppression -- not its class, and no diagnostic -- so
  it was left out of a change whose gate was outcome equality.
- **The binding seeder re-walks the file per member access.** `seed_bindings_before`
  restarts at the file root for every identifier receiver and re-resolves every
  binding's declared type, so cost grows with member accesses times bindings.
  Two accesses here; a real C# file has many more. The collector's per-request
  memo does not reach inside the seeder.
- **The file-namespace probe itself.** A six-segment namespace still expands to
  about 28 candidate short names for one simple type name. That is the true size
  of the set of short names a C# declaration could be stored under, so cutting it
  further needs a store lookup keyed on the fq name rather than on the short
  name.

The first three are collector-level defects with the same shape as the ones
fixed here. The fourth is a store schema question. None is a reason to hold the
measured improvement.
