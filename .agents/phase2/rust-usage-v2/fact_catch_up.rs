//! Bringing the persisted Rust facts up to date before a usage query reads
//! them.
//!
//! Milestone 3 of `.agents/plans/rust-usage-index-v2.md`. Under v2 a usage
//! answer is composed from the `rust_*` fact rows of live blobs, so a live file
//! whose blob carries no rows is not merely slow to answer -- it is invisible.
//! Analysis persists those rows for every file it reconciles, so the gap is
//! narrow: a store write that failed and left a dirty in-memory state, or a
//! blob that reached the live set without ever being persisted.
//!
//! The policy is IntelliJ's small-change lazy catch-up (research report section
//! 5.2, `ChangedFilesCollector.ensureUpToDateAsync`, whose own threshold is
//! twenty): below [`RUST_FACT_CATCH_UP_INLINE_LIMIT`] files, re-parse and
//! persist them on the querying thread, so a single-file edit never surfaces a
//! readiness state at all; at or above it, hand the batch to the dedicated
//! build pool and report the readiness probe false until it drains.
//!
//! There is no index to build here, which is the whole point: the "warm" is
//! this same catch-up, and on a healthy workspace it finds nothing to do.
