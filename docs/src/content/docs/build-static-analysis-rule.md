title: Build a Static-Analysis Rule
description: Take a query from RQL exploration to a tested CLI, MCP, Python, or Rust integration.
---

A Bifrost rule is a versioned `CodeQuery` plus code that interprets every returned result and its completeness metadata. This guide builds a small “direct calls to Python `eval`” rule, then shows the production concerns that remain the same for richer reference, call, hierarchy, and import pipelines.

This example is a structural policy: it finds parsed call expressions whose callee is named `eval`. It does not prove runtime dispatch, taint, reachability, or data flow. Choose a graph step and proof filter when declaration identity matters, and choose another analysis engine when the policy requires an unsupported guarantee.

## 1. Explore In RQL

Start the interactive prompt from the target repository:

```bash
bifrost --root /path/to/project --repl
```

Enter the narrowest structural query that expresses the policy:

<!-- code-query-test:rql:rule-eval -->
```lisp
(result-detail full
  (limit 1000
    (language python
      (call :callee (name "eval")))))
```

Run `:validate`, then `:run`. Inspect positive matches and nearby non-matches before treating the shape as a policy. Use `:ir python` with representative source when you need to see the normalized syntax Bifrost actually matches.

## 2. Inspect And Pin Canonical JSON

Run `:json` in the RQL prompt. Save the resulting canonical model under the analyzed workspace, for example as `queries/no-direct-eval.json`, and include the schema version explicitly:

<!-- code-query-test:json:rule-eval -->
```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "languages": ["python"],
  "match": {
    "kind": "call",
    "callee": {"name": "eval"}
  },
  "limit": 1000,
  "result_detail": "full"
}
```

RQL and JSON are peer frontends to the same query model. Pinning `schema_version` makes an incompatible future engine reject the rule instead of quietly interpreting a changed shape. Keep language and path scope in the saved query so every execution surface analyzes the same policy.

## 3. Execute Through One Supported Surface

Use one integration as the production owner of the rule. The other forms are useful for local debugging and parity checks.

### CLI

```bash
bifrost --root /path/to/project --query-file queries/no-direct-eval.json
```

The CLI prints an envelope whose `structuredContent` is the `CodeQueryResult`. Check `isError` before reading it.

### Agent MCP

Expose `query_code` with `symbol|extended` or `searchtools`, then call it with exactly:

```json
{"query_file":"queries/no-direct-eval.json"}
```

The path is relative to the active workspace. Do not send raw inline RQL or combine `query_file` with other fields.

### Python

```python
from bifrost_searchtools import SearchToolsClient

with SearchToolsClient("/path/to/project") as client:
    result = client.query_code(
        {"kind": "call", "callee": {"name": "eval"}},
        languages=["python"],
        limit=1000,
        result_detail="full",
        schema_version=2,
    )
```

The Python method accepts the canonical query fields as typed arguments; it does not currently accept `query_file`. Keep the checked-in JSON as the source of truth and test that the arguments constructed by the integration remain equivalent when the rule changes.

### Rust

```rust
use brokk_bifrost::analyzer::structural::CodeQueryResult;
use brokk_bifrost::SearchToolsService;
use serde_json::json;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn run_rule(root: PathBuf) -> Result<CodeQueryResult, String> {
    let service = SearchToolsService::new_without_semantic_index(root)?;
    let result = service.query_code_result(json!({
        "schema_version": 2,
        "languages": ["python"],
        "match": {"kind": "call", "callee": {"name": "eval"}},
        "limit": 1000,
        "result_detail": "full"
    })).map_err(|error| error.to_string())?;
    Ok(result)
}
```

`query_code_result` returns the Rust `CodeQueryResult` directly. Constructing `SearchToolsService` owns workspace indexing and file watching for a long-lived integration. Use `new_without_semantic_index` when this rule does not need the optional embedding service.

## 4. Consume Every Result Variant

Dispatch on `result_type` in JSON, the corresponding Python dataclass, or `CodeQueryResultValue` in Rust. Do not assume a pipeline will always end in a structural match: changing or appending a typed step changes the terminal value.

| `result_type` | Produced by | Consume as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `structural_match` | A query with no steps | Parsed shape, source snippet, captures, enclosing symbol, and optional full ranges/ID. |
| `declaration` | Enclosing, semantic-user, caller/callee, hierarchy, member, or owner steps | Exact indexed declaration identity and source range. |
| `reference_site` | `references_of` | Exact source site, target declaration, optional enclosing declaration, reference kind, and proof. |
| `call_site` | `call_sites_to` or `call_sites_from` | Caller, callee, call/callee ranges, receiver, arguments, call kind, and proof. |
| `expression_site` | `call_input` | Direct receiver or formal-parameter expression at a resolved call site. |
| `receiver_analysis` | `receiver_targets`, `points_to`, or `member_targets` | Explicit analysis outcome plus bounded receiver values or exact member declarations. |
| `file` | `file_of`, `imports_of`, or `importers_of` | Exact project file reached by the pipeline. |

In Python, the seven classes are `CodeQueryMatch`, `CodeQueryDeclaration`, `CodeQueryReferenceSite`, `CodeQueryCallSite`, `CodeQueryExpressionSite`, `CodeQueryReceiverAnalysis`, and `CodeQueryFile`. In Rust, match all variants of `brokk_bifrost::analyzer::structural::CodeQueryResultValue` without a wildcard so a future result type becomes a compile-time integration decision.

Request `result_detail: "full"` when a report needs stable IDs, byte/line/column ranges, capture ranges, or decorator ranges. Compact mode is designed for agent context, not durable finding identity.

## 5. Gate On Safety Metadata

Before a rule passes, fails, or claims completeness:

1. Treat a transport or validation error as a rule execution failure, not as zero findings.
2. Inspect every capability and execution diagnostic. A diagnostic can mean part of the requested language or role was not searched.
3. Require `truncated == false` for a complete rule result. Raising only `limit` may not remove a scan or pipeline-work budget diagnostic; narrow the query or split the scope when necessary.
4. Decide whether `unproven` graph edges are findings, warnings, or excluded evidence. Never present them as proven.
5. Check `provenance_truncated` on every derived result before claiming that all paths to that result are represented.
6. For `receiver_analysis`, branch on every `outcome`. Do not treat `unknown`, `unsupported`, or `exceeded_budget` as an empty candidate set, and do not flatten an `ambiguous` set into several independently precise findings.

Use [Agent Result Safety](/agent-result-safety/) for the exact claim vocabulary and zero-result rules.

## 6. Add Fixture Regression Tests

Keep the smallest source project that demonstrates a true positive, a nearby false positive, and any important language diagnostic. Assert the canonical query, complete tagged result, proof fields, and `truncated: false`; do not assert only a match count.

For Bifrost's own documentation, the executable marker harness in `tests/code_query_tutorials.rs` builds inline projects from `code-query-fixture` blocks and executes paired RQL/JSON cases. External integrations can use their normal test framework, but should preserve the same properties:

- RQL and canonical JSON lower to the same query while RQL is part of authoring.
- Every expected finding includes a stable project-relative path and exact range.
- Unsupported language features retain their diagnostic instead of becoming a zero-match assertion.
- Dynamic candidates test their `proven` or `unproven` contract explicitly.
- A negative fixture is structurally similar enough to catch an over-broad rule.

## 7. Integrate With CI And Reports

Run the saved query against the exact revision being reviewed. Record the Bifrost version or commit, `schema_version`, query file hash or revision, workspace root, source revision, and whether the run was cold or warm when timing matters.

For a CI gate, fail closed on execution errors, diagnostics that affect the intended scope, or truncation. Then apply the rule's policy to the typed findings. For a report, map each finding from its result variant rather than guessing a location: structural matches use `node_range` in full mode, declarations use their declaration range, reference/call/expression sites carry explicit ranges, and receiver analyses cite the analyzed input range while retaining the enclosing outcome around their candidates.

Bifrost does not currently emit a universal policy-report format from `query_code`. If the consumer needs SARIF or another interchange format, write a small adapter that preserves `result_type`, path/range, proof, diagnostics, and reproducibility metadata. Do not flatten importer files into symbol usages or structural matches into resolved declarations during conversion.

## Production Checklist

- The saved canonical JSON pins `schema_version` and contains all scope.
- The integration handles all seven terminal result variants and every receiver-analysis outcome.
- Errors, diagnostics, result truncation, proof tiers, and provenance truncation have explicit policy.
- Fixture tests cover a true positive, a convincing negative, and relevant diagnostics.
- CI records the engine, query, workspace, and source revisions.
- Reports cite exact returned locations and do not claim unsupported control or data flow.
