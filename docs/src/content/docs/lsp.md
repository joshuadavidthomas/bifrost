title: LSP Server
description: Run Bifrost as a language server for editor code intelligence.
---

Bifrost can run as a Language Server Protocol server over stdio. Start it with an explicit workspace root:

```bash
bifrost --root /path/to/project --lsp
```

The server does not open a network port. It speaks LSP over stdin and stdout, builds the workspace index in the background, and lets the first request wait for indexing when necessary.

## Editor Integrations

Install the packaged extension from the
[Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Brokk.bifrost-vscode)
for [VS Code](/vscode/), or from
[Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/brokk/bifrost-vscode) for
[Cursor](/cursor/). Both editor integrations start Bifrost in LSP mode; the
separate Cursor agent plugin starts an MCP server instead.

## Workspace Root

`--root` is the fallback workspace root. During LSP initialization, clients may send `workspaceFolders`, `rootUri`, or `rootPath`; Bifrost uses those client-provided roots when available. Use `--root` to make the server process deterministic and to provide a fallback when the client does not send a usable workspace root.

Each selected root honors root and nested `.bifrostignore` files. Matching files
are excluded from code intelligence even when tracked by Git, while file-level
tools can still inspect them. See [Workspace Scope](/workspace-scope/) for
syntax, visibility, and live-refresh behavior.

Clients can also pass Bifrost-specific `initializationOptions`:

```json
{
  "roots": ["src", "tests"],
  "exclude": ["target", "vendor/generated"],
  "unrecognizedSymbolDiagnostics": false
}
```

`roots` limits indexing to selected directories under the fallback root. `exclude` removes generated output, dependency caches, or other directories from workspace symbols and document-level lookups.

## Runtime Configuration

Bifrost supports the LSP 3.18 [`workspace/didChangeConfiguration`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.18/specification/) notification. When the client advertises `workspace.configuration`, Bifrost requests the complete `bifrost` section with `workspace/configuration`. Clients without configuration-pull support can push the complete settings object directly or nest it under `bifrost`:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "bifrost": {
      "roots": ["src", "tests"],
      "exclude": ["target"],
      "formatterCommands": [],
      "unrecognizedSymbolDiagnostics": false
    }
  }
}
```

Each accepted runtime value is a full snapshot. It replaces the startup `initializationOptions` and the previous runtime value; omitted or empty `roots`, `exclude`, `formatterCommands`, and `unrecognizedSymbolDiagnostics` fields therefore reset those settings to their defaults. Unknown fields are ignored, while an invalid recognized field rejects the complete snapshot and leaves the last working configuration active.

Changing only `formatterCommands` affects later formatting requests without rebuilding the analyzer. Changing `roots` or `exclude` rebuilds the workspace, preserves open editor buffers, cancels active formatter processes before swapping state, and clears published diagnostics for files that leave the workspace. Clearing `roots` restores the latest workspace folders reported by the editor.

`unrecognizedSymbolDiagnostics` is an experimental opt-in lint. It is `false` by default because Bifrost's symbol resolver is not yet accurate enough to make those editor errors trustworthy. Set it to `true` to publish unrecognized symbol and member diagnostics; syntax diagnostics are always enabled. Ruby currently contributes only high-confidence project-local constant-path diagnostics. It intentionally does not diagnose unknown Ruby methods or members: `method_missing`, runtime patching, gems, autoloading, and framework conventions make their absence unsafe to claim. Kotlin currently contributes only high-confidence unresolved-type diagnostics: an unqualified type reference is reported only once it fails every tier of Kotlin's own resolution ladder — the file's imports, its own package, star imports, Kotlin's default imports, the wider JVM source realm (Java/Scala declarations in the same workspace), and the external (jar-backed) dependency index. A type reachable only through an unconfigured classpath stays silent, and it intentionally does not diagnose unknown members, functions, or properties. C++ uses an additional high-confidence gate: the workspace root must contain a valid `compile_commands.json` entry matching the file. Bifrost currently reports only simple unknown type references with fully proven project include context, and intentionally stays silent for system headers, macros or conditional preprocessing, templates, dependent names, members, and calls. When the compile database records more than one configuration for a file, Bifrost proves the include closure of each configuration separately and reports a missing type only where every configuration agrees that it is absent.

## Protocol Surface

Bifrost advertises LSP capabilities only after the matching handler exists. Unsupported requests return JSON-RPC `MethodNotFound`; unsupported notifications are ignored.

Current support includes incremental and whole-document text synchronization, save notifications, diagnostics, definition/type-definition/implementation, hover, signature help, completion, references, rename, document highlights, document symbols, full-document semantic tokens, formatting, folding ranges, workspace symbols, type and call hierarchy, workspace folder and runtime configuration changes, watched-file notifications, startup progress, formatting cancellation, and cooperative cancellation plus client-owned work-done progress for references requests.

Semantic tokens color analyzer-known declarations and structured references from the current overlay-aware document snapshot. Bifrost advertises a stable high-level legend to compatible clients and leaves ordinary syntax coloring to the editor; semantic-token range and delta requests are not currently advertised. To keep the serial LSP request loop responsive, documents larger than 1 MB or with more than 10,000 structured identifier candidates receive an empty semantic-token result. Go workspaces above 64 files or 2 MB of current source receive declaration tokens without the more expensive workspace-wide reference resolution.

References progress is emitted only when the request supplies a `workDoneToken`; partial reference results are not streamed. Broader cancellation/progress support for workspace symbols, diagnostics, semantic tokens, and hierarchy remains an intentional follow-up area. Code actions, server-side execute commands, and pre-save hooks are not advertised until Bifrost has concrete safe edits or commands to expose.

## CLI Tooling

For terminal checks and scripts, use [one-shot CLI tool mode](../cli/) instead of starting an LSP session.
