title: CI Gating with GitHub Actions
description: Run Bifrost policies in CI and show findings as pull-request annotations through GitHub code scanning.
---

Bifrost ships a reusable GitHub Action that runs static-analysis policies and uploads the SARIF report to GitHub code scanning. GitHub then shows each finding as a pull-request annotation and tracks alert lifecycle across runs.

## Quick start

Add one workflow file:

```yaml
name: bifrost-policies

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:

permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write

jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: BrokkAi/bifrost/.github/actions/policy-scan@v0.9.1
```

The default configuration installs the pinned Bifrost release, runs the `bifrost.code-smells` pack on the checkout, writes `bifrost-policy.sarif`, uploads it, and gates on the exit code.

The `security-events: write` permission is required for the SARIF upload. Code scanning must be available on the repository.

## Exit codes

The gate distinguishes three results:

- `0` - clean. The job passes.
- `1` - findings at or above the `fail-on` threshold. The job fails and the findings appear as code-scanning alerts.
- `2` - unreliable. The run could not prove its own completeness, for example after a budget or capability limit. The job fails with a distinct message. Do not treat an unreliable run as clean, and do not lower `fail-on` to hide it. Read the report diagnostics instead.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `version` | pinned release tag | Bifrost release to install. Pin an exact tag for reproducible gates. |
| `policy-packs` | `bifrost.code-smells` | Space-separated built-in pack IDs. |
| `policy-ids` | empty | Space-separated policy IDs. |
| `policy-categories` | empty | Space-separated categories. |
| `policy-files` | empty | Space-separated workspace-relative `.rqlp` files. |
| `fail-on` | `warning` | Severity gate: `never`, `finding`, `note`, `warning`, or `error`. |
| `diff-base` | empty | Git revision to diff against. Only findings absent from that revision gate. |
| `sarif-file` | `bifrost-policy.sarif` | SARIF output path, relative to `working-directory`. |
| `upload` | `true` | Upload the SARIF file to code scanning. |
| `category` | `bifrost-policy` | Code-scanning category. Use one category per scan configuration. |
| `cache` | `true` | Restore and save the analyzer cache between runs. |
| `working-directory` | `.` | Workspace root to analyze, relative to the checkout. |

The action exposes these outputs for later steps:

| Output | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `exit-code` | Raw bifrost policy exit code (0, 1, or 2). |
| `sarif-file` | Path of the SARIF report, relative to the checkout. |
| `bifrost-bin` | Absolute path of the bifrost executable the run used. |

## Analyzer cache

The action caches `.bifrost/cache` at the checkout root. The database keys rows by Git blob object ID, so a cache saved on one branch stays valid for every file that other branches did not change. A pull-request run restores the most recent cache and re-analyzes only the files it changed. The cache saves when the job completes successfully, so a gate that fails does not write one. Keep the workflow enabled and green on the default branch so pull requests always find a warm cache to restore.

## New findings on pull requests

Code scanning compares the alerts from the pull-request analysis with the base branch and marks new alerts on the pull request. Upload from both the default branch and pull requests, with the same `category`, to get that comparison.

## Gate only on findings the pull request introduced

By default the gate fails on every finding, including pre-existing debt. To fail a pull request only on the findings it introduced, pass the pull request's base commit as `diff-base`. Bifrost then evaluates the same policies against that commit's content, classifies every finding as `new` or `persisting` by its stable finding identity, and computes the exit code from the new findings only. Each SARIF result carries the standard `baselineState` field (`new` or `unchanged`).

```yaml
jobs:
  scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: BrokkAi/bifrost/.github/actions/policy-scan@v0.9.1
        with:
          diff-base: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
```

The checkout must contain the base revision: `fetch-depth: 0` is the simple form, or fetch the base SHA explicitly. If the base revision does not resolve, the run exits `2` (unreliable) rather than silently gating on everything. If the base revision resolves but its evaluation cannot prove its own completeness, the run degrades to full gating and reports a `diff-base-unreliable` diagnostic, so a broken base can never hide new findings.

Two identity limitations are accepted: a pure file rename re-keys every finding in the file (one `fixed` plus one `new`), and inserting an identical duplicate of an existing source slice above it under the same owner can shift the ordinal that distinguishes the duplicates and misclassify one pair.

## Onboard a legacy repository with a committed baseline

`diff-base` narrows pull-request gates, but scheduled full runs and release gates still fail on every pre-existing finding. To accept the existing debt once and gate only on what appears afterwards, generate a baseline locally and commit it:

```bash
bifrost --root . --policy-pack bifrost.code-smells --accept-current
git add .bifrost/baseline.json
git commit -m "Accept existing bifrost.code-smells findings as the baseline"
```

`--accept-current` writes `.bifrost/baseline.json` from a completed run's strong finding identities under one batch-level reason; an unreliable run refuses to write and exits `2`. Every later CI run — full or `diff-base` — honors the committed document exactly as the CLI does: baselined findings stay in the report and the SARIF upload as accepted suppressions, stop gating, and are audited for drift (a policy edit) and staleness (a finding proven fixed). Keep the same selection (`policy-packs`, `policy-ids`, `policy-files`) in CI that you accepted locally, and regenerate explicitly when you intend to re-accept — the baseline never refreshes itself.

A recommended split for a legacy repository: pull requests gate with `diff-base` (findings the change introduced), while the scheduled full run and the release gate rely on the committed baseline (everything new since acceptance), burning the baseline down by fixing findings, which the audit then reports as stale entries to prune.

## Suppressions, scope, and baseline

The run honors `.bifrost/suppressions.json`, `.bifrost/policy-scope.json`, and `.bifrost/baseline.json` from the workspace, exactly as the CLI does. Accepted suppressions and baselined findings appear in the SARIF report as suppressed results. See [Static-Analysis Policies](/static-analysis-policies/) for the document formats.
