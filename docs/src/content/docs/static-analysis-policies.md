title: Static-Analysis Policies
description: Author reusable RQLP rules and endpoints, run structural and semantic policies, and interpret complete human, JSON, or SARIF reports.
---

Bifrost static-analysis policies are human-readable S-expressions stored in
`.rqlp` files. They add stable rule identity, reporting metadata, composition,
and completeness semantics around native [Rune Query Language
(RQL)](/rune-query-language/) selectors. JSON is available as a normalized or
reporting form, but it is not an alternate RQLP authoring syntax.

> **Current execution boundary:** Bifrost executes match-, taint-, typestate-,
> and assertion-analysis policies. Taint resolves typed source and sink
> bindings, compiles compatible demand, runs bounded set-oriented propagation,
> and renders retained findings. Unsupported or incomplete semantic boundaries
> remain non-clean completion states rather than empty successful results.

> **Important:** An RQL selector returns analysis candidates. An endpoint
> selector match is diagnostic-neutral. Neither an endpoint match nor the
> co-presence of a source and sink proves reachability, and neither creates a
> finding by itself.

## One Document Per File

Every `.rqlp` file contains exactly one top-level document:

| Document | Purpose | Executable root? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(policy ...)` | Defines one rule, its report metadata, and exactly one `match`, `taint`, `typestate`, or `assertion` analysis. | Yes. |
| `(endpoint ...)` | Names one reusable, diagnostic-neutral source or sink selector with categories and a typed value/API binding. | No. It is loaded only as a dependency. |

Passing an endpoint to `--policy-file` is an error; Bifrost does not turn it
into a match policy behind the author's back.

### Built-in code-smell pack

The installed binary embeds `bifrost.code-smells`, a catalog of thirteen
structured match policies. It covers dynamic evaluation, unsafe Python object
deserialization, rayon parallelism inside blocking Rust lazy initializers,
and review prompts for sorting, regular-expression compilation,
file reads, serialization, parsing, database calls, network calls, subprocesses,
sleep, and expensive operations beneath nested loops. Every rule is an ordinary
checked-in `.rqlp` source with a stable ID and semantic hash; the manifest also
records its category, claimed languages, required capabilities, severity
rationale, and remediation.

Pack version 1.1 adds Rust coverage to eight performance policies. The Rust
selectors recognize the standard slice `sort*` family, `Regex::new`,
`fs::read` / `fs::read_to_string`, `serde_json::{to_string, to_vec, from_str,
from_slice}`, `bincode::{serialize, deserialize}`, `toml::from_str`, direct
`reqwest::get` and `ureq::{get, post}` requests, and `thread::sleep`. These are
language- and API-specific normalized call shapes, not source-text matches. The
pack does not claim Rust database or
subprocess coverage yet: common APIs expose generic instance methods whose
resolved receiver type is not available to structural match policies, so a
name-only rule would be too broad. Dynamic evaluation and unsafe object
deserialization also remain scoped to languages with a defensible equivalent.

Pack version 1.3 narrows `bifrost.performance.sleep-in-loop` to the `for_loop`
kind: a sleep that throttles every iterated item is worth review, while a
sleep inside a condition-controlled `while` loop is usually the deliberate
mechanism of a poll or bounded-backoff loop and no longer matches. Counting
loops that a language cannot lexically distinguish from iteration (Go's single
`for`, C-style `for`) stay outside the rule.

Pack version 1.5 adds `bifrost.correctness.rayon-in-blocking-lazy-init`, a
Rust-only review prompt for a blocking lazy-init call (`OnceLock::get_or_init`,
`OnceLock::get_or_try_init`, `Once::call_once`, `LazyLock::new`) whose
initializer closure lexically contains rayon parallelism (`par_iter`,
`into_par_iter`, `par_bridge`, `par_chunks`). When the first initialization
runs on a rayon worker, the initializer's parallel join steals sibling jobs; a
stolen job that re-enters the same cell parks on it forever and can wedge the
whole pool. The match is lexical containment, not proof of a deadlock: a rayon
call inside a nested closure defined within the initializer also matches even
when that closure only runs later, and bare `rayon::join`, `rayon::scope`, and
`ThreadPool::install` are excluded because their unqualified names are too
generic for a name-based rule.

Use `bifrost --list-policies` or MCP `list_policies` to inspect the exact catalog
in the running build. Select it with `--policy-pack bifrost.code-smells`, a
`--policy-category`, or a stable `--policy-id`; MCP `run_policy` exposes the same
pack/category/ID selectors. These are deliberately review-oriented structural
matches. A call name or lexical location is evidence of the parsed shape, not
proof of runtime dispatch, loop invariance, or measured cost.

### A runnable match policy

This complete checked fixture selects direct Python call syntax whose callee is
named `eval`:

<!-- policy-doc-test:rqlp:tests/fixtures/policies/dynamic-eval.rqlp -->
```lisp
; Match policies are executable diagnostics. Omitting :schema-version selects
; the latest compatible policy schema, currently version 1.
(policy
  :id "bifrost.security.dynamic-eval"
  :name "No dynamic evaluation"
  :message "Dynamic evaluation is forbidden"
  :severity warning
  :description "Reject calls that execute source text as Python code."
  :tags ["security" "code-execution"]
  :analysis
    (analysis
      :type match
      :selector
        (rql
          (language python
            (call :callee (name "eval"))))))
```

`match` is currently the only analysis type that executes end to end. Its RQL
result is evidence for the surrounding policy, so the policy—not the selector—
owns the finding message, severity, identity, and completion state. A callee
name match is still a structural fact; it does not by itself prove runtime
dispatch.

The documentation test runs that exact policy against this source through the
current `bifrost` binary:

<!-- policy-doc-test:source:dynamic-eval -->
```python
def run(user_code):
    return eval(user_code)
```

With `--fail-on never`, the complete human report is:

<details>
<summary>Checked current output</summary>

<!-- policy-doc-test:human:dynamic-eval -->
```text
note: policy bifrost.security.dynamic-eval inferred policy schema 1 and RQL schema 1
[warning]  app.py:2:12
    Dynamic evaluation is forbidden

summary: 1 active finding; 0 suppressed findings; 1 complete policy run
```

</details>

The same run with the default `warning` threshold produces identical report
text and exits 1. Add `--verbose` to include the complete finding identity,
evidence, provenance, proof, classification, rule schema, and manifest record.

## Schema Versions And Selectors

Policy/endpoint schema versions and nested RQL schema versions resolve
independently:

| Source form | Omitted version | Explicit version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `(policy ...)` or `(endpoint ...)` | Select the newest compiled-in version in the compatible policy lineage (currently 1). | An exact pin; unsupported versions fail instead of falling back. |
| `(rql QUERY)` | Select the compatible RQL head (currently 1). | Add `:schema-version N` for an exact RQL pin. |
| `(rql-file :path "queries/rule.rql")` | With no wrapper pin, an explicit pin in the referenced document wins; if both omit a version, resolve the compatible RQL head. | A wrapper pin is exact; an explicit referenced-document pin must agree. |

File-backed selectors have four version-resolution cases:

| `rql-file` wrapper | Referenced `.rql` document | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Omitted | Native query with no version envelope | Resolve the latest compatible RQL version (currently 3); the version is inferred. |
| Exact pin `N` | Native query with no version envelope | Use exact `N`; the wrapper supplies the explicit pin. |
| Omitted | `(rql :schema-version N QUERY)` | Use exact `N`; the referenced document supplies the explicit pin. |
| Exact pin `N` | `(rql :schema-version N QUERY)` | Use exact `N`; the agreeing referenced-document pin is retained as the resolution origin. |

If the wrapper and referenced document pin different versions, loading fails
with `conflicting-rql-schema-version`; an exact unsupported version also fails
instead of falling back. A referenced `.rql` file accepts only a raw native
query or the exact `(rql :schema-version N QUERY)` envelope shown above.
Source-only editor validation cannot read the referenced file, so it reports
this resolution as deferred until workspace loading.

Omission is a safe compatibility fallback, not “accept any latest schema.” The
engine chooses only a registered compatible successor. Use explicit pins for a
reproducible release artifact, or run with
`--require-explicit-schema-versions` to reject every inferred policy, endpoint,
and RQL version in the dependency closure.

An inline `(rql ...)` selector is lowered directly from the nested S-expression.
An `(rql-file ...)` selector names one workspace-relative `.rql` file and is
resolved only by a workspace-backed loader. There is no ambient policy,
endpoint, query, catalog, environment, or network discovery.

## Reusable Endpoints

An endpoint has a stable ID, a human display phrase, one `source` or `sink`
role, exact opaque categories, one selector, and one binding. Bindings can name
the matched value, receiver, return value, or an argument by zero-based index or
formal name. Optional taint semantics declare source labels/evidence or sink
accepted labels; they still do not make the endpoint a diagnostic.

<!-- policy-doc-test:rqlp:tests/fixtures/policies/endpoints/http-request-parameter.rqlp -->
```lisp
; A reusable match-only source. Loading this file never creates a diagnostic.
(endpoint
  :id "bifrost.sources.http-request-parameter"
  :name "HTTP request parameter"
  :display-name "User-controlled I/O"
  :description "A value supplied by an external HTTP request."
  :role source
  :categories [input.user-controlled io.external]
  :selector
    (rql
      (language python
        (call :callee (name "request_parameter"))))
  :binding return-value
  :taint
    (source-semantics
      :labels [attacker-controlled]
      :evidence
        (evidence
          :trust-boundary external
          :system-entry vulnerable-system-network-stack))
  :supersedes [])
```

Aggregate policies opt into endpoints with either:

- `(match-directory ...)`, which names one capability-rooted directory, a
  `direct` or `recursive` scope, and an exact `(any [...])` or `(all [...])`
  category predicate; or
- `(match-endpoints :ids [...])`, which selects exact endpoint IDs already in
  the immutable endpoint index.

Directory traversal is explicit, bounded, symlink-free, `.rqlp`-only, and can
pin `:manifest-sha256`. The directory semantic-hash projection contains its
selection predicate plus only the selected endpoint identities and their full
semantic hashes. The report's richer manifest also retains the reference path,
directory, scope, role, categories, definition and selector schemas, and
analysis-projection hashes. Imported endpoints become dependencies of the
policy; they do not create extra policy runs.

Endpoint `:supersedes` edges express same-event dominance. They apply only when
semantic compilation later establishes that two endpoints describe the same
event, role, and binding. Bifrost never infers precedence from selector text,
directory order, source location, message wording, or “more specific-looking”
categories. A missing target, cycle, or ambiguous live winner is an error.

### Catalogs

Large machine-managed taint libraries can be registered before policy loading
through `TaintCatalogRegistry` as typed values, canonical JSON bytes, or an
explicit workspace-relative JSON path. A policy then names a catalog by
`(catalog :name "catalog.id" :version N)` and may add `:sha256`.
Registration is versioned, content-addressed, bounded, and transactional. It
does not scan directories or access the network. Catalog JSON is a machine
registration contract, not a second human `.rqlp` syntax; human reusable
source/sink leaves should normally use endpoint documents.

## Analysis Types

| Type | Public authoring model | Evaluation in this release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `match` | One inline or file-backed RQL selector returning supported, location-bearing terminal results. | Executable. |
| `taint` | Set-oriented sources, sinks, sanitizers, transforms, external models, and optional finding combinations. | Executes the production compiler, compatible batch planner, solver, retained report, and human/JSON/SARIF projection. |
| `typestate` | Tracked subjects, typed events, deterministic transitions, uncertainty rules, and terminal expectations. | Executes query-local semantic bindings and emits production findings with stable identity, primary/related locations, bounded witnesses, and completeness metadata. |
| `assertion` | Either a subject selector that captures identifier tokens plus one or more `assert`, `assert-resolution`, `assert-binding-scope`, `assert-boundary`, `assert-canonical`, `assert-route`, or `assert-round-trip` invariants about the [occurrence](/rune-query-language/) each captured token carries and about how it resolved; or a relational plan of `bind`, `join`, `group`, and `assert` records over typed rows. | Executes. Correlates captures to occurrence, candidate, and binding rows by AST identity and emits one multi-location finding per violated invariant or violated row group. |

### Taint: broad libraries, specific findings

The taint policy below selects every compatible user-controlled source and
sensitive-data sink from one explicit directory. The generated fallback uses
the fixed `{source display-name} can reach {sink display-name}` relation. A
specific combination supplies more actionable wording:

<details>
<summary>Checked taint policy fixture</summary>

<!-- policy-doc-test:rqlp:tests/fixtures/policies/attacker-controlled-to-sensitive-sinks.rqlp -->
```lisp
; Broad compatible source/sink pairs use the generated relation. The specific
; PII combination supplies a more actionable message and explicitly wins.
(policy
  :schema-version 1
  :id "bifrost.security.attacker-controlled-to-sensitive-sinks"
  :name "Attacker-controlled data reaches a sensitive sink"
  :message (generated-message :relation can-reach)
  :severity warning
  :analysis
    (analysis
      :type taint
      :mode may
      :sources
        (endpoint-set
          :include-matches [
            (match-directory
              :path "tests/fixtures/policies/endpoints"
              :scope recursive
              :categories (all [input.user-controlled]))])
      :sinks
        (endpoint-set
          :include-matches [
            (match-directory
              :path "tests/fixtures/policies/endpoints"
              :scope recursive
              :categories (any [data.pii data.sensitive]))])
      :finding-combinations [
        (finding-combination
          :id "user-input-to-pii"
          :source (categories :all [input.user-controlled])
          :sink (categories :all [data.pii data.sensitive])
          :message "User-controlled I/O can reach sensitive user PII"
          :supersedes [])]))
```

</details>

A generated message is emitted only after the taint analysis reports an
actual compatible source/sink meeting. Merely matching both endpoint selectors
does **not** license “can reach.” For one actual pair, an applicable explicit
combination replaces the generated default. If multiple explicit combinations
apply, `:supersedes` must leave one unique winner; it never creates a second
solver run or duplicate finding.

Categories, display phrases, and finding messages select and present this
composition. They do not become propagation keys or change the solver's
set-oriented run identity.

### Assertion: what the parser must say about a token

An assertion policy is a conformance rule about the analyzer's own output. The
subject selector captures identifier tokens; each `assert` states the
occurrence role, class, and cardinality that token must carry. The correlation
is an equality on AST identity -- the captured node and the occurrence row name
the same arena node -- so an assertion can never be satisfied by a coincidence
of spelling or range.

<details>
<summary>Checked assertion policy fixture</summary>

<!-- policy-doc-test:rqlp:tests/fixtures/policies/role-fidelity.rqlp -->
```lisp
; Assertion policies are diagnostic-neutral conformance rules. The subject
; selector finds candidate tokens; each `assert` states what the parser must
; say about the token captured under `:at`, joined by AST identity rather than
; by spelling. Omitting :schema-version selects the latest compatible policy
; schema, currently version 1.
(policy
  :id "bifrost.conformance.logger-is-never-rebound"
  :name "Logger is never rebound"
  :message "The module logger must be read, never rebound by a local of the same name"
  :severity warning
  :description "A local named `logger` shadows the module logger and silently changes which sink receives the record."
  :tags ["correctness" "shadowing"]
  :analysis
    (analysis
      :type assertion
      :subject
        (rql
          (identifier :text/regex "^logger$" :capture "token"))
      :asserts [
        (assert
          :id no-rebinding
          :at "token"
          :role binder
          :expect none)]))
```

</details>

`:at` must name a capture on the **token** being asserted about, not on its
declaration. Capturing `(function :name "render")` addresses the function node,
while the occurrence lives on the identifier inside it, so the two would
correctly fail to join and the assert would report an absence.

`:expect` is one of `declaration`, `reference`, `binding`, or `none`, and
`:cardinality` is `(exactly N)`, `(at-least N)`, or `(at-most N)`, defaulting to
`(exactly 1)`. `:expect none` and `(exactly 0)` mean the same thing and must
agree; a role whose class can never satisfy the stated `:expect` is rejected
when the document loads rather than evaluated to a guaranteed verdict.
`:namespace` narrows to `type`, `value`, `module`, `macro`, or `label`, and
`:require-target` additionally demands that reference-class rows resolved.

#### Asserting how a name resolved

Three further assert records state *why* a name means what it means. They share
the subject selector, the AST-identity join, and the soundness rules above, and
each carries a required `:role` naming the reference-class occurrence role it is
about, so capability reporting narrows to exactly that role.

`(assert-resolution :id ID :at CAPTURE :role ROLE :expect-tier TIER)` requires
the candidate the resolver selected to sit at one precedence tier. The tiers are
ordered strongest first -- `lexical_binding`, `own_member`, `inherited_member`,
`explicit_import`, `package_or_module`, `wildcard_import`, `external_root`,
`name_only_fallback` -- and `:at-least true` accepts any tier at least as strong
as the named one. `:forbid-tier TIER` removes one tier from the accepted range,
and `:require-unique true` makes ambiguity a violation rather than a silent
pick. A combination no tier can satisfy is rejected when the document loads.

`(assert-binding-scope :id ID :at CAPTURE :role ROLE :declared inside|outside
:relative-to CAPTURE2)` requires the binding actually in effect at the captured
reference to be declared inside, or outside, a second captured node. This is the
loop-invariance predicate: capture a loop and the receiver of a call inside it,
then require the receiver's binding to be declared inside the loop. The half
that declares it outside -- and therefore sorts the same list on every iteration
-- is the finding. `:relative-to` may not name the same capture as `:at`, whose
containment is fixed.

`(assert-boundary :id ID :at CAPTURE :role ROLE :forbid-fallback-past
external_declared_unindexed|external_unknown)` forbids a `name_only_fallback`
selection once resolution reached or passed one authoritative boundary. It is a
prohibition, so a reference where nothing was selected satisfies it.

`(assert-canonical :id ID :at CAPTURE :role ROLE :equals CAPTURE :equals-role
ROLE [:distinct true])` requires the two captured tokens' resolved declarations
to share one canonical identity -- language, namespace, ordered kind-tagged
name segments, and generic arity, compared structurally and never by rendered
text. `:distinct true` inverts it: the selections must share none, which is how
a same-terminal decoy (two `Map`s under different owners) is separated from the
true target. `:equals` may not name the same capture as `:at`, whose comparison
is fixed.

`(assert-route :id ID :at CAPTURE :role ROLE :to CAPTURE :to-role ROLE [:via
HOP] [:forbid HOP])` requires an identity route from the captured site to what
the `:to` capture resolves to. The traversal follows the identity-preserving
hop kinds (alias, import, export, re_export) plus whatever `:via` names, and
`:via` additionally requires at least one hop of that kind on the matching
route -- `(assert-route ... :via re_export)` is how "this facade genuinely
forwards the origin" is spelled. A traversal that ends in a cycle or a
truncation is inconclusive, never evidence of absence.

`(assert-round-trip :id ID :at CAPTURE :role ROLE)` requires forward
resolution and inverse enumeration to close: every declaration the site's
route reaches must reach the site back through inverse edges over the involved
files. The mined regressions this family answers are the ones where the
forward and inverse sides of one indirection quietly disagreed.

Three absences make these asserts inconclusive rather than passing or failing:
a selected candidate whose recording seam could not name a tier (an absent tier
is not the weakest tier); an assert that needs the whole considered set on a
language whose resolver records selections but not rejections; and a reference
for which nothing was selected at all. A capture with no lexical binding in
effect is not one of them -- that is a complete answer, so a containment
requirement over an absent binding is simply skipped.

#### Relational assertions over typed rows

The asserts above each address one captured token. An assertion policy can
instead state an invariant over named relations of typed rows. It replaces
`:subject` and `:asserts` with a plan: `(bind ...)` names one relation, either
an RQL query or an expansion of an earlier binding; `(join ...)` relates two
bindings by equal-typed registered fields, as an inner join or an anti-join;
`(group ...)` groups the joined rows by registered fields and computes named
`(aggregate ...)` values; and `(assert :group NAME :value NAME :cardinality
...)` bounds one aggregate in every group. A group that violates its assertion
becomes one finding anchored at the exact source ranges of the rows that
produced it. A binding the query engine had to truncate makes the run
inconclusive, never clean.

The aggregate operations are `count`, `count-distinct`, `min`, and
`ordered-equal`. The first three fold one column. `ordered-equal` compares two
ordered sequences instead, each named by its own integer position field and the
value read at that position:

```lisp
(aggregate :name parity :op ordered-equal
  :left (arg.argument_index arg.name)
  :right (param.parameter_index param.label))
```

It yields one when the two sequences hold the same value at every position and
have the same length, and zero otherwise, so `:cardinality (exactly 1)` states
complete list parity. Position awareness is the point: a call that passes the
same named arguments in a different order is equal to the declaration as a set
and different as a list. A sequence is recovered from the group's rows rather
than from row order, so two states are undefined and never reported as parity:
a row that states no position, and two rows that claim one position and
disagree.

Whether a length difference is visible is a property of your join, not of the
predicate. Joining on the compared value keeps only positions that already
matched on both sides, and two such projections have equal length by
construction; joining on a correlation key instead -- one call site to one
callable -- puts both complete sequences in the group.

`(assert-selected-in-winning-tier :id ID :site NAME :candidates NAME
[:cardinality ...])` is authoring sugar over the callable-applicability rows.
`:site` names a binding of `overload-selection` rows and `:candidates` a
binding of `callable-applicability` rows for the same sites. It lowers to one
inner join on `site_ast_id`, one group keyed on the site, one aggregate
counting the candidates that are both `selected` and `applicable`, and one
cardinality assertion -- exactly what you could write by hand, which is why it
reports through the same finding path. The winning tier is the set of
candidates the resolver's own applicability check accepted. The default
cardinality `(exactly 1)` is the uniquely resolved site; `(exactly 0)` states a
site where the resolver accepted nothing; `(at-least 2)` states a site that
bound more than one accepted candidate.

An undecided candidate is not an accepted one. A candidate whose verdict is
`unknown` -- the language does not report the callable axis, or it never
recorded that declaration's parameter list -- is not counted, so a site whose
candidates are all undecided counts zero accepted candidates and violates the
default cardinality. Bind the sites your invariant is about, and read the
`overload-selection` row's `resolution` and `supported` fields when you need to
tell an undecidable site from a resolved one. A site the resolver enumerated no
candidate for contributes no tuple to the join at all, so it forms no group and
is never asserted.

#### Completeness in a relational plan

A relational assertion counts rows, so the one completeness signal it can act
on is a bound row that says its own producer suppressed the row *set* it heads.
Today exactly one row says that: a `call_shape` row whose `coverage` is not
`exact`. A macro-derived or otherwise unreadable argument list emits no
argument-group and no argument row at all, precisely so it cannot look
byte-identical to a real zero-argument call, and binding such a row makes the
whole run inconclusive rather than clean.

That signal lives on the mandatory `call_shape` row, so a plan that asserts
anything about a call's arguments must bind that row. A plan that binds only
the projected argument rows sees a legitimately empty set for a macro-derived
site and reports it clean:

```lisp
(bind :name shape :query (rql (call-shape (occurrences :role [member_position]))))
(bind :name arg :query
  (rql (call-arguments (call-argument-groups
    (call-shape (occurrences :role [member_position]))))))
(join :left shape :right arg :on ((site_id site_id)))
```

Nothing weaker poisons the run. An `unknown_shape` overload summary, an
undecided candidate verdict, and a signature whose arity the language never
recorded all publish exact values in their own fields and emit every row they
head, so a whole file is never reported inconclusive because one site in it was
undecidable. Exclude those rows with `:where` when your invariant needs them
excluded.

#### A worked loop-invariance rule

The rule below is the reason `assert-binding-scope` exists. A structural rule that
only asks "is this call written inside a loop" cannot tell a collection built
inside the loop and canonicalized once from a collection built before the loop
and re-sorted on every pass; the second is the waste worth reporting and the
first is not. The requirement is therefore that the sorted receiver be declared
*inside* the loop, and the violation is the half declared outside it.

<details>

</details>

Two boundaries in that rule are worth copying into any rule built on this
predicate. A receiver that is a *field projection* of the loop variable
(`group.packages.sort()`) is not addressed at all: the capture is the projection
rather than an occurrence of a receiver role, so the assert abstains, under
either polarity. And a call inside a closure is reported because it is written
inside the loop, which is a lexical fact rather than a claim about how often the
body runs -- so the message says exactly that instead of asserting per-iteration
cost.

Soundness is stricter here than for a match policy, because `none` and
`exactly` are claims about a *set*. If the subject query or the occurrence scan
is incomplete for any reason -- an adapter that marks the asserted role
unsupported, a truncated result, an exhausted budget -- the run reports
`inconclusive` with **no** findings and exits with status 2. A partial row set
can make a satisfied assertion look violated as easily as the reverse, so an
assertion over incomplete input is never a pass and never a clean.

### Typestate: endpoint reuse plus protocol rules

Typestate policies reuse endpoint selectors and bindings for tracked subjects
and phase-specific API observations, then add a protocol automaton:

              :expected-states [closed]
              :supersedes [])])))
```

</details>

Endpoint observations retain their matched-value, receiver, return, or argument
binding and their observation phase. Accepting states are not absorbing: later
events can transition away from them. Normal and exceptional **analysis-root**
exits can require that an accepting state was already reached; helper returns
remain interprocedural transfers, not implicit terminals. A terminal-expectation
violation is distinct from a transition into an error state.

`:call-modeling` is shared by taint and typestate policies. `paranoid` is the
default when the record is omitted and conservatively models transfers that are
justified by the structured call site. `optimistic` preserves existing facts
without introducing unseen-body transfers, while `require-model` abstains when
no applicable model exists. Every fallback retains incomplete call-boundary
evidence; none of these settings turns an unresolved call into proof of safety.

Endpoint categories and display/report text remain outside automaton and
interprocedural-summary keys; the protocol analysis consumes resolved endpoint
identity, binding, phase, and behavior.

## Checked Normalized Fragments

These compact JSON fragments are generated from the parsed typed authoring
model and checked against the complete fixture golds. They show normalized
authored JSON only: unresolved file, endpoint, directory, or catalog references
can remain, and this form is not a policy-hash input. The reported
`policy_hash` comes from the distinct loaded and composed canonical semantic
model after the loader has resolved the complete dependency closure. Rendered
report JSON is a third projection over policy runs and findings; it is neither
of those definition forms. JSON is not accepted as `.rqlp` source in any role.

Endpoint source semantics:

<!-- policy-doc-test:json:tests/fixtures/policies/endpoints/http-request-parameter.normalized.json#/taint -->

    "trust_boundary": "external"
  },
  "labels": [
    "attacker-controlled"
  ],
  "type": "source"
}
```

The explicit taint presentation rule:

<!-- policy-doc-test:json:tests/fixtures/policies/attacker-controlled-to-sensitive-sinks.normalized.json#/analysis/finding_combinations/0 -->
```json

  "add_classifications": [],

## Completeness, Findings, And Report Parity

A policy run is not just a list of findings:

- `complete` with zero findings is a clean result only for the analyzer,
  workspace, selector, and budgets used by that invocation. The policy report
  does not currently record the analyzer version, workspace root/revision, or
  configured budget maxima; preserve those separately as described in
  [Reproduce an Analysis](/reproduce-analysis/).
- `inconclusive` (including cancellation or budget reasons), `unsupported`, or
  `failed` is non-clean even when zero findings were retained. Existing positive
  findings remain useful bounded evidence, but the run cannot support a complete
  negative claim.
- Query diagnostics carry typed impact. Capability or work omissions propagate
  into policy completion instead of being flattened into an empty match set.

Every finding is built from one canonical typed model. Human, canonical JSON,
and SARIF 2.1.0 therefore retain the same rule and semantic hashes, finding ID,
location, severity, certainty, completion, endpoint/combination or terminal
identity, classifications, evidence, witnesses, and CVSS variants.

Strong finding IDs use semantic/source anchors and occurrence ordinals—not line
numbers or absolute native paths—so unrelated preceding-line changes do not
churn them unless they introduce an equal earlier anchor and therefore change
the ordinal. A weak ID is labeled inconclusive and is deliberately omitted
from SARIF `partialFingerprints`; it is not promoted into a fake stable
fingerprint.

## Review Findings With Exact Suppressions

Keep project-owned analysis inputs together and keep generated cache data
separate:

```text
.bifrost/
├── queries/                 # saved exploratory .rql
├── policies/                # recurring .rqlp roots
├── suppressions.json        # exact review decisions
├── policy-scope.json        # directory-level review decisions
└── cache/                   # generated; safe to ignore
```

The conventional suppression file is `.bifrost/suppressions.json`. Version 1
contains accepted review decisions for exact strong findings:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "suppressions": [
    {
      "policy_id": "bifrost.security.dynamic-eval",
      "finding_id": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
      "identity_stability": "strong",
      "status": "accepted",
      "reason": "This evaluator runs only a checked-in migration script",
      "policy_hash_at_acceptance": "abcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd",
      "accepted_by": "security-review",
      "accepted_at": "2026-07-27",
      "expires_at": "2026-10-27"
    }
  ]
}
```

`policy_id` and `finding_id` are the complete join key. Bifrost applies a
record only to a current finding whose identity is strong and exactly equal.
It never falls back to paths, lines, globs, regular expressions, messages,
similar code, or weak identities. Unrelated line insertions and policy
presentation changes can preserve the ID. Editing the selected source bytes,
moving the file, changing its semantic owner, or changing the duplicate
occurrence ordinal produces a different ID and leaves the old decision for
review.

Use an explicit date for a reproducible accept-and-rerun cycle:

```bash
bifrost --root . \
  --policy-file .bifrost/policies/dynamic-eval.rqlp \
  --evaluation-date 2026-07-27 \
  --format json \
  --fail-on warning
```

Copy the reported strong finding ID, policy ID, and optional policy hash into
the suppression file, record a bounded reason and acceptance date, then run
the same command again. The second canonical report still contains the
finding and one suppression review, but an applied decision does not meet the
failure threshold. SARIF retains the result, its `bifrostFinding/v1`
fingerprint, and a standard external accepted suppression. Concise human
output hides the result from the active-finding list while counting it;
`--verbose` prints the reason and provenance.

The audit keeps independent states instead of collapsing review outcomes:

- A current exact strong match is `applied`. A changed `policy_hash` is also
  marked `drifted`, but hash drift alone does not reactivate the same finding.
- A record is `expired` only when the evaluation date is later than
  `expires_at`; it remains active on the expiration date itself.
- An unmatched record is `stale` only when the selected policy completed and
  proved that the finding is absent.
- An unselected, incomplete, failed, unsupported, or inconclusive policy
  cannot prove staleness. A current weak finding also cannot prove the strong
  match required for suppression.
- A retention-limit failure is explicit as `result_omitted` and makes the
  report unreliable rather than claiming a clean result.

A missing conventional or explicit suppression file means no suppressions.
Malformed, unsafe, oversized, escaping, duplicate, or conflicting input
produces a report diagnostic, applies none of that document, and exits with
status 2. Use `--suppressions-file PATH` for one workspace-relative override.
The CLI uses today's UTC date if `--evaluation-date` is omitted; library, LSP,
and MCP callers supply the date explicitly to the deterministic coordinator.

## Scope Directories Out Of The Gate

An exact suppression accepts one finding of one rule version. Some
acceptances are instead standing statements about a directory: a checked-in
fixture corpus intentionally contains the code smells its tests assert, or a
test tree is not performance-sensitive, so performance review prompts there
are noise. Recording those per finding means every new fixture or test
re-dirties the gate. The conventional scope file `.bifrost/policy-scope.json`
records the directory-level decision once:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "scopes": [
    {
      "path": "tests/fixtures",
      "reason": "Intentional smell corpus used as policy test fixtures."
    },
    {
      "path": "tests",
      "reason": "Test code is not performance-sensitive.",
      "policy_categories": ["performance"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each entry names one workspace-relative directory with a mandatory reason.
`path` follows the portable path rules: forward slashes, no absolute paths,
no `.` or `..` components. Matching is a component-wise directory prefix on
the finding's primary location, so `tests` covers `tests/app.py` but never
`tests_extra/app.py`. Entries have no expiry: a directory scope describes
what the directory is, not one review cycle.

An entry without selectors applies to every policy. `policy_ids` and
`policy_categories` restrict it, as a union: the entry applies to a policy
whose stable id is listed or whose built-in category is listed. Categories
exist only for built-in pack policies, so an entry that should also cover a
repository `.rqlp` policy must list its id or omit selectors entirely. Two
entries may share a path when their selectors differ.

Scoping is applied after evaluation and after suppressions, and it never
hides anything. A scoped finding stays in the canonical report with an
attached `scope` decision (path and reason) and stops counting toward the
failure threshold, exactly like a suppressed finding; a finding that already
carries a suppression is not claimed by scope. The report's top-level `scope`
array audits every entry with its matched-finding count. An entry that
matched nothing is reported as unapplied so dead entries stay visible, and
concise human output hides scoped findings from the active list while
counting them in the summary.

This is deliberately not `.bifrostignore`. That file removes paths from
analysis entirely (navigation, search, usages); a scoped directory is still
fully analyzed and still visible in reports; only the policy failure status
changes.

A missing scope file means no scoping. A malformed one produces a
`scope-load-failed` report diagnostic, applies none of that document, and
exits with status 2, so a broken scope file can never silently accept
findings. Use `--scope-file PATH` on the CLI or `scope_file` on the MCP
`run_policy` tool for one workspace-relative override; both default to
`.bifrost/policy-scope.json`.

## Gate Only On What The Change Introduced

A full policy run fails a repository for every finding, including debt that
predates the change under review. `--diff-base REV` turns the same run into a
changed-code gate: the identical policies also evaluate the committed content
of `REV`, findings are joined across the two revisions by `(policy_id,
finding_id)`, and the failure threshold counts only the findings whose
identity is absent from the base.

```bash
bifrost --root . \
  --policy-pack bifrost.code-smells \
  --format sarif --output out.sarif \
  --diff-base origin/main
```

The join works because a strong finding identity hashes only content-derived
facts: the workspace-relative path, the semantic owner key, a digest of the
matched source bytes, and a small ordinal for identical slices under one
owner. It contains no absolute path, revision, timestamp, or run-local
handle, so the same finding in unchanged content produces the same identity
at both revisions. The base revision is exported into a private temporary
directory and analyzed there; the checkout is never touched.

Each retained finding gains a `diff` decision (`new` or `persisting`, plus a
`weak_identity` marker), and the report gains one top-level `diff` review
with the requested revision, the resolved commit, the three counts, and the
fixed identities the head no longer produces. Weak identities are
snapshot-local by construction, so a weak finding never joins and always
classifies as new. Suppressions and scope still apply first: a suppressed or
scoped new finding does not gate, exactly as in a full run. SARIF results
carry the standard `baselineState` field (`new` or `unchanged`; fixed base
findings are not emitted as results), and concise human output hides
persisting findings while the summary reports all three counts.

The reliability contract is asymmetric on purpose. An unresolvable base -- a
workspace outside a git repository, or a revision `git rev-parse` cannot
resolve -- fails the run with status 2: an unresolvable base is an unreliable
diff request, never a silent full run. A base that resolves but whose
evaluation cannot prove its own completeness instead degrades to full gating:
every head finding gates as if `--diff-base` had not been given, the review
records `degraded: true`, and a `diff-base-unreliable` report diagnostic
states why, so a broken base can never hide new findings and can never be
mistaken for a clean diff run.

Two identity limitations are accepted rather than solved. A pure file rename
re-keys every finding in the file (the path is part of the identity), so a
rename reports one `fixed` plus one `new` pair. Identical source slices under
one owner are distinguished by an ordinal, so inserting an exact duplicate
above an existing one can shift the ordinals and misclassify one pair.

The base evaluation is a full second in-memory analysis of the base tree; it
shares no analyzer cache in this version. For the GitHub Actions recipe that
passes the pull request's base SHA, see
[CI Gating with GitHub Actions](/ci-github-actions/).

## Accept Today's Findings, Gate Tomorrow's

A repository adopting Bifrost can carry hundreds to thousands of pre-existing
findings. The suppression store is deliberately the wrong tool for that scale:
it caps at 512 identity-exact records and demands a reviewed reason for each,
which is right for governed waivers and wrong for onboarding. `--diff-base`
removes the pressure from pull-request gates, but scheduled full runs and
release gates still need "accept everything that exists today, gate everything
new." That is the baseline document:

```bash
bifrost --root . --policy-pack bifrost.code-smells --accept-current
```

`--accept-current` runs the selected policies and writes
`.bifrost/baseline.json` (override with `--baseline-file`) from the completed
run: per policy, the sorted strong finding-id hashes plus the policy's
semantic hash at acceptance, under one batch-level reason and acceptance date.
Entries are identity-only — no per-record prose — so the document holds up to
100,000 entries in at most 16 MiB, two decimal orders beyond the suppression
cap. Acceptance is written only by a clean run: an unreliable run refuses to
define a baseline and exits 2 without writing, because an identity the run
could not prove cannot be accepted. Weak-identity findings are never written
(their identities are snapshot-local), and their excluded count is reported.
Regeneration is always an explicit re-run; the baseline never refreshes
itself.

On every later run the document joins by `(policy_id, finding_id)` after
suppressions and directory scope claim their findings; a finding already
suppressed or scoped is not claimed by the baseline, and its entry is audited
as `finding_claimed`. Claimed findings stay in the report with a `baseline`
decision and stop counting toward `--fail-on`, in full and in `--diff-base`
runs alike: gating counts findings that are new and unclaimed by suppression,
scope, and baseline. The report gains one top-level `baseline` review with the
document path, the batch metadata, exact per-state counts, and a bounded
needs-attention entry list (anything other than applied-with-matching-hash;
the counts stay exact when the list truncates). SARIF renders each baselined
finding as an external accepted suppression entry whose property bag carries
`bifrost.decision: "baseline"`, and concise human output hides baselined
findings while the summary reports the counts.

The audit rules mirror suppressions. A malformed or oversized document is a
diagnostic and exit 2; a baseline never turns an unreliable run clean. Editing
a policy marks its entries drifted without reactivating them — a drifted entry
still applies, and the drift count in the review is the signal to re-review.
An entry is stale only when an exhaustive completed run proves the finding
absent; an incomplete run reports `policy_incomplete` instead of guessing. The
`--diff-base` identity limitations apply unchanged: a rename or an edited
source slice re-keys the finding, so the old entry goes stale and the re-keyed
finding gates until it is re-accepted or fixed.

For the onboarding recipe that commits the baseline once and keeps
pull-request gates on `--diff-base`, see
[CI Gating with GitHub Actions](/ci-github-actions/).

## Classification And CVSS v4.0

A policy can declare one broad fallback taxonomy classification plus typed
refinements. Refinements add evidence-backed classifications; they do not erase
the fallback. A winning taint finding combination can also add classifications.

CVSS is reduced from typed evidence. Policy input never supplies or overrides a
numeric score. A scored CVSS v4 Base assessment requires all eleven Base metrics
with coherent metric/value/scope evidence and no Base `X`. Missing or conflicting
evidence remains an explicit unscored variant with reasons. Threat,
Environmental, and analyst overlays stay separate from static policy assertions;
incompatible records are not averaged, spliced, or resolved by provider order.
Organizational risk is reported separately from CVSS.

## Run Policies From The CLI

Pass every runnable root explicitly. File-backed selectors and endpoint
dependencies are resolved from their authored query-file, exact-endpoint, and
directory references:

```bash
bifrost --root docs/fixtures/ten-minute-evaluation \
  --policy-file policies/review-audit-call.rqlp \
  --format human \
  --fail-on never
```

This is the published, executable [ten-minute policy
example](/evaluate-bifrost/#journey-2-run-a-match-policy). Replace the root and
policy path with your project when authoring a rule of your own.

Repeat `--policy-file` to produce one deterministic combined report. Choose
`human`, `json`, or `sarif`; use `--output report.sarif` for synchronized,
same-directory atomic replacement instead of stdout.

The one-shot CLI starts with empty catalog and endpoint registries. A policy
which names a machine catalog must be loaded through an embedding that
explicitly populated `TaintCatalogRegistry`. A policy which uses only
`(match-endpoints :ids [...])` likewise needs an embedding to pre-register those
endpoint IDs. In an ordinary CLI run, the same policy can instead discover its
closed endpoint set through `(match-directory ...)` and then select exact IDs
from that set. The CLI does not guess paths or scan ambient directories.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | Every requested policy completed and no active unsuppressed finding met `--fail-on`, or the threshold was `never`. |
| `1` | Every requested policy completed and at least one active unsuppressed finding met the threshold. |
| `2` | Policy, suppression, or scope loading, schema validation, composition, evaluation, completeness, serialization, or output was unreliable. This takes precedence over status 1. |

`--fail-on` accepts `never`, `finding`, `note`, `warning` (the default), or
`error`; `finding` includes unrated findings. It changes only the complete-run
finding threshold. It cannot turn an invalid, incomplete, cancelled, or
unsupported run into status 0. Taint and typestate policies execute through the
production semantic engine; cancellation, budgets, incomplete selector
discovery, semantic uncertainty, unmodeled call boundaries, and witness
truncation remain visible in run/finding completeness instead of becoming clean
zero-results. Source-backed taint works without external models. An embedding
must explicitly supply and activate a semantic-model catalog when external
procedure summaries are required.

See [CLI](/cli/#static-analysis-policies) for option interactions and
[Reproduce an Analysis](/reproduce-analysis/) for the artifacts to preserve.

## Author In VS Code

The Bifrost extension registers `.rqlp` as the distinct **Bifrost RQL Policy**
language. It provides source-only validation, schema-resolution hover,
optional-version completion, 100-column formatting, and a distinct **Run RQL
Policy** action while preserving comments and omitted version fields. Nested
RQL receives RQL highlighting only inside `(rql ...)`.

The policy action sends the current unsaved root to the workspace-backed
loader, which resolves saved query and endpoint dependencies and reads the
conventional suppression file. Active findings appear under **Bifrost Policy
Results**; applied findings move into its suppression audit with stale,
expired, drifted, and unproven review states. `.rqlp` remains separate from
the ordinary RQL query action and never publishes policy findings into
**Bifrost Query Results**. See [RQL in VS
Code](/rql-vscode/#rql-policy-documents).
