# Local pre-push validation gate (#1454).
#
# Composition matches the documented gate in CLAUDE.md "Rust CI Checks":
# fmt, the featureless workspace test suites, and the isolated-target
# all-features workspace clippy. Two structural changes cut the wall clock
# roughly in half versus running the same steps by hand:
#
#   1. cargo-nextest schedules every test binary under one global scheduler
#      (the per-binary serialization of `cargo test` gated each suite's start
#      on the previous suite's slowest test) and enforces the per-test
#      slow-timeout in .config/nextest.toml, so a hung test is named and
#      killed instead of stalling the gate silently.
#   2. The all-features clippy shares nothing with the test target dir (it
#      runs under scripts/with-isolated-cargo-target.sh), so it runs
#      concurrently with the tests instead of after them.
#
# Nextest does not run doctests, so a `cargo test --doc` step remains.
# Before any build starts, the gate also removes Cargo artifacts older than
# seven days. Cargo retains every obsolete feature/profile hash indefinitely;
# without this sweep, the shared target directory can grow by hundreds of GiB.
#
# The all-features clippy needs a PyO3-capable interpreter. If PYO3_PYTHON is
# not already set and `uv` is available, the clippy leg runs through
# `uv run --python 3.12 --` per CLAUDE.md; otherwise it uses the ambient
# environment and fails loudly if that environment cannot link PyO3.
