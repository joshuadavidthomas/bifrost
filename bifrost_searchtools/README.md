# brokk-bifrost-searchtools

Fast, structured code search and analysis for Python, backed by a native Rust
extension. This is the Python distribution of [bifrost](https://github.com/BrokkAi/bifrost),
the Tree-sitter-backed analyzer suite that powers [Brokk](https://brokk.ai).

It gives you one in-process client that talks straight to the Rust analyzer (no
subprocess, no MCP server) and returns typed results plus ready-to-render text.
It understands Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Python, C++, C#, PHP, and
Scala.

- **Install:** `pip install brokk-bifrost-searchtools`
- **Import as:** `bifrost_searchtools`

## What it does

Index a project once, then ask fast structural questions:

- **Symbol search:** find classes, functions, and fields by name pattern.
- **Locations and sources:** jump to a symbol's definition or pull its source.
- **Summaries:** get a signature-level outline of a file or directory.
- **Usages and call graph:** scan references to a symbol, or build the
  whole-workspace caller/callee graph (feed it to PageRank for a code map).
- **Most-relevant files:** rank the files most related to one or more seed files.
- **Semantic search:** find code by meaning, using ONNX embeddings and a
  cross-encoder reranker (opt-in).

## Quick start

```python
from bifrost_searchtools import SearchToolsClient

with SearchToolsClient("/path/to/project") as client:
    # Signature-level outline of a file
    print(client.get_summaries(["src/main.py"]).render_text())

    # Find symbols by name pattern
    for file in client.search_symbols(["parse_*"], limit=10).files:
        print(file.path)

    # Rank the files most related to a seed file
    print(client.most_relevant_files(["src/main.py"]).render_text())
```

The client indexes on first use, keeps the index warm for the session, and
watches the filesystem so later queries see your edits. Every result has typed
fields plus a `render_text()` helper.

For a runnable end-to-end demo, [`examples/searchtools_demo.py`](https://github.com/BrokkAi/bifrost/tree/master/examples)
declares its dependency inline (PEP 723), so `uv` fetches the package and runs it
with no manual install:

```bash
uv run examples/searchtools_demo.py --root /path/to/repo Calculator compute
```

Pass `render_line_numbers=False` to drop line numbers from rendered text while
keeping the structured line metadata on the result objects.

The git tools return a `GitTextResult` (`.text`), the slopcop tools return a
`CodeQualityReport` (`.report`), and the rest return structured dataclasses from
`bifrost_searchtools.models`. The per-rule tuning knobs on the smell reports are
passed through `options` (keys map 1:1 to the Rust tool arguments).

## `query_code` detail and ranges

`query_code` is the version-2 typed query surface. Omit `schema_version` for v2
or pass `schema_version=2` explicitly. The structural `pattern` can be followed
by ordered `steps` using `enclosing_decl`, `file_of`, `imports_of`,
`importers_of`, `supertypes`, `subtypes`, `members`, and `owner`. Import
operations traverse one direct project-local edge per step. Hierarchy operations
are direct by default and accept a positive `depth` or `transitive: true`.
Declaration results are limited to declarations indexed by the workspace
analyzer, so references into an unindexed library do not manufacture library
declarations. Results are tagged as structural matches, declarations, reference
sites, call sites, expression sites, or files.
Compact output retains minimal pipeline provenance. Pass `result_detail="full"`
when follow-up tooling needs deterministic IDs and precise ranges.

For decorated or annotated declarations, `node_range` is the matched normalized
node's parser-backed range. `decorator_ranges` are the decorator or annotation
role spans extracted by the language adapter. `decorated_range` is the union of
`node_range` and those decorator ranges. Matching semantics are unchanged by
requesting full detail; these fields only make the span policy explicit.

### Current structural precision

`query_code` normalizes common syntax across Python, Java, JavaScript,
TypeScript, Go, C/C++, Rust, PHP, Scala, C#, and Ruby, but it is still a
syntactic structural query tool. Use these caveats when writing reusable rules
or prompts; the [public Code Querying guide](https://brokkai.github.io/bifrost/code-querying/)
is the canonical reference:

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Constructor calls | Java object creation and JS/TS `new` expressions are normalized as `call`; constructors are also refined as `constructor` declarations where the adapter can identify them. |
| Keyword arguments | Python, PHP, Scala, C#, and Ruby support normalized `kwargs`; other adapters report unsupported-role diagnostics. |
| Imports and aliases | Import matching is based on syntactic module/import spans. It does not resolve aliases or follow re-exports. |
| Receiver and callee | `callee.name` and `receiver.name` are derived from AST fields and terminal names, not type resolution. Chained calls stay syntactic. |
| Decorators and annotations | Decorators/annotations are exposed through the `decorators` role. Full detail reports `node_range`, `decorator_ranges`, and `decorated_range`. |
| Positional arguments | `args` patterns match positional arguments in order as a subsequence; v2 does not require exact positions or arity. |
| Typed pipelines | Declaration, hierarchy, and ownership steps preserve exact indexed identities; import steps follow direct workspace file edges and may be repeated. |
| Unsupported capabilities | Queries against unsupported normalized kinds or roles return diagnostics instead of silently pretending the language can answer them. |

## Semantic search

`semantic_search(...)` searches code by meaning rather than name and returns the
three retrieval legs directly: function-oriented vector and BM25 rankings over
function-level chunks, plus a file-oriented co-edit ranking. It searches code,
not prose.

It is opt-in. Set `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=auto` to enable background indexing;
the models load via ONNX and download from the HuggingFace hub on first use. The
[semantic search docs](https://brokkai.github.io/bifrost/semantic-search/) list
every environment override.
