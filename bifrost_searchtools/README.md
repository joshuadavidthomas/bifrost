# brokk-bifrost-searchtools

Fast, structured code search and analysis for Python, backed by a native Rust
extension. This is the Python distribution of [bifrost](https://github.com/BrokkAi/bifrost),
the Tree-sitter-backed analyzer suite that powers [Brokk](https://brokk.ai).

It gives you one in-process client that talks straight to the Rust analyzer (no
subprocess, no MCP server) and returns typed results plus ready-to-render text.
It understands Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Go, Python, C++, C#, PHP, and
Scala.

- **Install:** `pip install brokk-bifrost-searchtools`
- **Import as:** `bifrost_searchtools`

## What it does

Index a project once, then ask fast structural questions:

- **Symbol search:** find classes, functions, and fields by name pattern.
- **Locations and sources:** jump to a symbol's definition or pull its source.
- **Summaries:** get a signature-level outline of a file or directory.
- **Usages and call graph:** scan references to a symbol, or build the
  whole-workspace caller/callee graph (feed it to PageRank for a code map).
- **Most-relevant files:** rank the files most related to one or more seed files.
- **Semantic search:** find code by meaning, using ONNX embeddings and a
  cross-encoder reranker (opt-in).

## Quick start

```python
from bifrost_searchtools import SearchToolsClient

with SearchToolsClient("/path/to/project") as client:
    # Signature-level outline of a file
    print(client.get_summaries(["src/main.py"]).render_text())

    # Find symbols by name pattern
    for file in client.search_symbols(["parse_*"], limit=10).files:
        print(file.path)

    # Rank the files most related to a seed file
    print(client.most_relevant_files(["src/main.py"]).render_text())
```

The client indexes on first use, keeps the index warm for the session, and
watches the filesystem so later queries see your edits. Every result has typed
fields plus a `render_text()` helper.

For a runnable end-to-end demo, [`examples/searchtools_demo.py`](https://github.com/BrokkAi/bifrost/tree/master/examples)
declares its dependency inline (PEP 723), so `uv` fetches the package and runs it
with no manual install:

```bash
uv run examples/searchtools_demo.py --root /path/to/repo Calculator compute
```

Pass `render_line_numbers=False` to drop line numbers from rendered text while
keeping the structured line metadata on the result objects.

The git tools return a `GitTextResult` (`.text`), the slopcop tools return a
`CodeQualityReport` (`.report`), and the rest return structured dataclasses from
`bifrost_searchtools.models`. The per-rule tuning knobs on the smell reports are
passed through `options` (keys map 1:1 to the Rust tool arguments).

## `search_ast` detail and ranges

`search_ast` is an experimental v1 query surface. Omit `schema_version` for v1
or pass `schema_version=1` explicitly when callers want to pin the shape.
Compact output is the default: matches include project-relative path, language,
normalized kind, line range, a short snippet, captures, and an enclosing symbol
when available. Pass `result_detail="full"` when a rule, refactoring step, or
follow-up tool call needs precise locations. Full detail adds deterministic
match ids plus byte offsets and 1-based character columns for matches and
captures.

For decorated or annotated declarations, `node_range` is the matched normalized
node's parser-backed range. `decorator_ranges` are the decorator or annotation
role spans extracted by the language adapter. `decorated_range` is the union of
`node_range` and those decorator ranges. Matching semantics are unchanged by
requesting full detail; these fields only make the span policy explicit.

### Current structural precision

`search_ast` normalizes common syntax across Python, Java, JavaScript, and
TypeScript, but it is still a syntactic structural search tool. Use these
caveats when writing reusable rules or prompts:

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Constructor calls | Java object creation and JS/TS `new` expressions are normalized as `call`; constructors are also refined as `constructor` declarations where the adapter can identify them. |
| Keyword arguments | Python supports `kwargs`; Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript currently report unsupported-role diagnostics for `kwargs`. |
| Imports and aliases | Import matching is based on syntactic module/import spans. It does not resolve aliases or follow re-exports. |
| Receiver and callee | `callee.name` and `receiver.name` are derived from AST fields and terminal names, not type resolution. Chained calls stay syntactic. |
| Decorators and annotations | Decorators/annotations are exposed through the `decorators` role. Full detail reports `node_range`, `decorator_ranges`, and `decorated_range`. |
| Positional arguments | `args` patterns match positional arguments in order as a subsequence; v1 does not require exact positions or arity. |
| Unsupported capabilities | Queries against unsupported normalized kinds or roles return diagnostics instead of silently pretending the language can answer them. |

## Semantic search

`semantic_search(...)` searches code by meaning rather than name and returns the
three retrieval legs directly: function-oriented vector and BM25 rankings over
function-level chunks, plus a file-oriented co-edit ranking. It searches code,
not prose.

It is opt-in. Set `BIFROST_SEMANTIC_INDEX=auto` to enable background indexing;
the models load via ONNX and download from the HuggingFace hub on first use. The
[main bifrost README](https://github.com/BrokkAi/bifrost#semantic-search) lists
every environment override.
