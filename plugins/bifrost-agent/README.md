# Bifrost Agent Plugin

This package installs Bifrost's MCP server configuration as an agent plugin for
Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor, and ships a generated Amp skill bundle. It does
not bundle the Bifrost binary; it
installs a launcher that resolves a released Bifrost binary and makes a
multi-language code analysis subset of the `bifrost` MCP tools discoverable
through each host's plugin or skill system. It also bundles the Brokk/Bifrost
workflow skills and specialist agents so the plugin is a one-stop shop for code
intelligence, GitHub issue work, and code review workflows in hosts that support
the broader plugin package.

The Claude Code and Codex stable install name is `brokk`. Cursor uses the
Cursor-facing plugin name `bifrost` so the package is discoverable as Bifrost in
Cursor's Customize UI. The public marketplace namespace is `bifrost`, so
Claude/Codex marketplace installs read as `brokk@bifrost` where the host exposes
namespace-qualified install names.

The plugin starts `./bin/bifrost-launcher.mjs --mcp "symbol|extended"`.
The launcher always starts Bifrost with an explicit `--root`, using
`BIFROST_WORKSPACE_ROOT` when set, then a host-provided `--root` or
`--workspace-root`, then the host session working directory.
Claude Code and Codex read this server entry from `.mcp.json`; Cursor reads the
same entry from root `mcp.json`, using Cursor's documented `type: "stdio"`
field. Amp uses a different direct server-map shape for `mcp.json` and
`--mcp-config`, so the generated Amp bundle lives under
`plugins/bifrost-agent/amp-skills`.

Binary resolution order is:

1. `BIFROST_BINARY_PATH`, when set.
2. The launcher-managed cache for the pinned Bifrost release.
3. A compatible `bifrost` already on `PATH`, only when
   `BIFROST_LAUNCHER_ALLOW_PATH=1` is set.
4. A checksum-verified GitHub release download into the managed cache.

Set `BIFROST_LAUNCHER_AUTO_INSTALL=0` to disable downloads, or
`BIFROST_LAUNCHER_CACHE_DIR=/path/to/cache` to choose the managed cache
location. `BIFROST_BINARY_PATH` is the preferred local development override
because it bypasses ambient `PATH` lookup. Launcher diagnostics go to stderr so
stdio MCP traffic stays on stdin/stdout.

For local development, build this checkout and point the launcher at the debug
binary:

```bash
cargo build --bin bifrost
BIFROST_BINARY_PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug/bifrost" node plugins/bifrost-agent/bin/bifrost-launcher.mjs --root . --mcp "symbol|extended"
```

## Codex Install

Add the Brokk marketplace from GitHub, then install Bifrost:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add BrokkAi/bifrost --sparse .agents/plugins --sparse plugins
codex plugin add brokk@bifrost
```

For local development from a checkout, add the repository root instead:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add "$(pwd)"
codex plugin add brokk@bifrost
```

For a local checkout build, start Codex with this repository's debug binary
selected explicitly:

```bash
BIFROST_BINARY_PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug/bifrost" codex
```

Start a fresh Codex session after installing the plugin. The plugin-provided
MCP server starts a separate stdio Bifrost process with:

```bash
bifrost --root <resolved-workspace-root> --mcp "symbol|extended"
```

The plugin gives Bifrost up to 60 seconds to start and up to 300 seconds for
individual analyzer tool calls. Large workspaces may need that budget because
Bifrost can build its persisted analyzer on the first real tool call.

The default plugin toolset intentionally omits Bifrost's `workspace` and `text`
MCP toolsets. That keeps local plugin installs focused on analyzer navigation
and avoids giving prompts a built-in way to switch the active workspace or read
arbitrary files through raw text tools. Users who explicitly want the full MCP
surface can still add a manual `codex mcp add` entry for `--mcp searchtools`.

Once the session starts, verify the tools by calling a lightweight analyzer
operation such as `get_summaries` or `search_symbols` against files in the
active workspace.

## Bundled Skills

The Bifrost plugin owns the skills that explain the analyzer-backed MCP tools
it installs, plus the broader Brokk/Bifrost workflow skills that build on those
tools:

- `bifrost-code-navigation`: definitions, references, call sites, and related
  files with `search_symbols`, `get_symbol_locations`, `scan_usages`, and
  `most_relevant_files`.
- `bifrost-code-reading`: source summaries and exact symbol bodies with
  `get_summaries` and `get_symbol_sources`.
- `bifrost-codebase-search`: symbol, usage, file, and related-file discovery
  with shell grep reserved for arbitrary text.
- `brokk-git-exploration`: git-history exploration and commit inspection.
- `brokk-guided-issue`: end-to-end GitHub issue resolution.
- `brokk-guided-review`: interactive review of local changes, branches, or
  remote PRs with specialist reviewer agents.
- `brokk-review-pr`: adversarial multi-agent PR review.
- `review`: concise code-review guidance for ordinary review requests.
- `brokk-today`: GitHub issue and PR work-queue triage with a Slack-ready
  summary.
- `brokk-write-issue`: issue drafting with source-code context.

The plugin also includes the specialist reviewer and issue-planning agents used
by those workflows. The default plugin MCP toolset still does not expose
Bifrost's `workspace` lifecycle tools, so the Brokk `workspace` skill is not
copied here. Workflow skills should rely on the host-provided workspace context
and the plugin's analyzer tools, or gracefully skip explicit workspace
activation when `activate_workspace` is unavailable.

Codex does not register plugin-provided `agents/*.md` files as named
`brokk:*` subagent types. The Codex manifest therefore loads generated skills
from `codex-skills/`; those files embed the specialist prompts and instruct
Codex to use generic subagents with the matching prompt. Do not edit
`codex-skills/` directly. Update `skills/` or `agents/`, then regenerate:

```bash
node scripts/generate-codex-skill-bundle.mjs
```

## Claude Code Install

Add the Brokk marketplace from GitHub, then install Bifrost:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add BrokkAi/bifrost --sparse .claude-plugin plugins
claude plugin install brokk@bifrost
```

Start a fresh Claude Code session after installing the plugin so the MCP server
configuration is loaded at startup.

## Claude Code Local Testing

From the repository root, start Claude Code with this package directory:

```bash
BIFROST_BINARY_PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug/bifrost" claude --plugin-dir plugins/bifrost-agent
```

Inspect `/plugin` to confirm the `bifrost` metadata loaded, then inspect `/mcp`
or ask Claude to call a lightweight analyzer operation such as `get_summaries`
or `search_symbols`.

To test the repository as a local Claude Code marketplace, run:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add "$(pwd)"
claude plugin install brokk@bifrost --scope local
BIFROST_BINARY_PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug/bifrost" claude
```

Start a fresh Claude Code session after installing the plugin so the MCP server
configuration is loaded at startup.

## Cursor Local Testing

From the repository root, build Bifrost and open Cursor with the local binary
selected:

```bash
cargo build --bin bifrost
BIFROST_BINARY_PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug/bifrost" cursor .
```

In Cursor, open **Customize**, then use **Manage -> Add Marketplace -> Import
from Disk** and select the repository root. Cursor should read
`.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`, find the `bifrost` plugin at
`plugins/bifrost-agent`, and offer it for installation. If testing the package
directory directly instead of the repository marketplace, select
`plugins/bifrost-agent`.

After installing, enable the Bifrost MCP server for the workspace from the
plugin's **MCPs** section in Customize. Cursor does not load installed MCP
servers into chat until they are enabled, and already-open agent chats may need
a fresh chat before newly enabled MCP tools appear. Then ask Cursor Agent to
call a lightweight analyzer operation such as `get_summaries` or
`search_symbols` against files in the active workspace. Use a source directory
or file, not `README.md`, so the smoke cannot pass through ordinary file
reading. For example:

```text
Use the Bifrost MCP get_summaries tool on src/analyzer/usages. Summarize the
package structure in five bullets and explicitly name the MCP tool result you
used.
```

The `cursor agent --plugin-dir` CLI path is useful for checking that Cursor can
load plugin skills, but it has not proven reliable for plugin-provided MCP
servers. Treat the desktop Customize/MCP path as the Cursor plugin MCP smoke.

To publish publicly, submit the repository URL at
<https://cursor.com/marketplace/publish>. The repository root contains
`.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`, which points Cursor at this shared package.

## Antigravity Install and Local Testing

Antigravity 2.2.1 can load Bifrost through a manual MCP entry in
`~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`. The visible **Add MCP** flow is a curated
marketplace, but the local config file accepts the standard `mcpServers` shape:
see Antigravity's official [MCP](https://antigravity.google/docs/mcp)
documentation for the host-side convention.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bifrost": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/bifrost/target/debug/bifrost",
      "args": [
        "--root",
        "/absolute/path/to/workspace",
        "--mcp",
        "symbol|extended"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Antigravity or click **Refresh** in **Settings -> Customizations**. The
tested app showed `bifrost` with 21 enabled tools after reading this file.

Antigravity documents skills under workspace and global skill directories; see
the official [Skills](https://antigravity.google/docs/skills) documentation for
the host-side convention. In Antigravity 2.2.1 validation, workspace-local
skills loaded reliably and appeared in project-specific settings. If global
skills do not appear in your app session, install the generated Bifrost
code-intelligence skill into each target workspace. The skill is named
`bifrost-code-intelligence` because it exposes the analyzer-backed navigation,
reading, search, and usage tools used by guided review workflows:

```bash
mkdir -p /absolute/path/to/workspace/.agents/skills
cp -R "$(pwd)/plugins/bifrost-agent/amp-skills/bifrost-code-intelligence" \
  /absolute/path/to/workspace/.agents/skills/bifrost-code-intelligence
```

Open the project-specific settings page in Antigravity. The project
**Customizations** section should list `bifrost-code-intelligence`. Validate
with a guided-review prompt that requires a Bifrost MCP tool on source code:

```text
Use the bifrost-code-intelligence skill for a guided review. Inspect the current changes, use the Bifrost MCP get_summaries tool on src/analyzer/usages for source context, and report review findings with file and line references.
```

## Amp Install and Local Testing

Amp uses a generated skill collection at
`plugins/bifrost-agent/amp-skills`. Do not edit files under that directory
directly; update the canonical code-intelligence skills in
`plugins/bifrost-agent/skills`, then regenerate the Amp bundle:

```bash
node scripts/generate-amp-skill-bundle.mjs
```

The generated Amp skill is intentionally narrower than the Claude/Codex/Cursor
plugin package. It includes one `bifrost-code-intelligence` skill, a skill-local
`mcp.json`, the Bifrost launcher, and the release metadata needed by that
launcher. It does not include the Brokk workflow/review skills or specialist
agents.

From the repository root, build Bifrost:

```bash
cargo build --bin bifrost
```

Install the generated Amp skill collection into the current workspace. Use an
absolute source path; Amp treats relative local skill sources like Git sources
in some CLI paths:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills
amp skill add "$(pwd)/plugins/bifrost-agent/amp-skills" --target "$(pwd)/.agents/skills" --overwrite
```

For a user-global install, use Amp's global skill target instead:

```bash
amp skill add "$(pwd)/plugins/bifrost-agent/amp-skills" --global --overwrite
```

After the Amp bundle has landed on the repository's default branch, install it
from GitHub with Amp's `owner/repo/path` source syntax:

```bash
amp skill add BrokkAi/bifrost/plugins/bifrost-agent/amp-skills --global --overwrite
```

Do not use a browser `https://github.com/.../tree/...` URL for Amp skill
sources. The tested Amp CLI did not accept branch-qualified GitHub skill
sources, so PR-branch validation should use a local checkout path and the
GitHub shorthand should be re-tested after merge.

The generated `mcp.json` uses Amp's direct server-map shape and a small shell
shim that locates `bifrost-code-intelligence/bin/bifrost-launcher.mjs` from the
workspace `.agents/skills` directory, the standard global Amp/agents skill
directories, or `BIFROST_AGENT_SKILL_DIR`. Start Amp from the workspace root, or
set `BIFROST_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/path/to/workspace`. For local checkout testing, set
`BIFROST_BINARY_PATH` so the launcher uses this build instead of downloading the
pinned release.

Validate with a prompt that requires an analyzer MCP tool on source code, not a
README or docs file:

```bash
BIFROST_BINARY_PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug/bifrost" amp -x \
  'Load the bifrost-code-intelligence skill. Use the Bifrost MCP get_summaries tool on src/analyzer/usages/rust_graph/*.rs and name three symbols from the MCP result.'
```

Amp skill collection installs preserve skill-local support files only when the
collection parent is installed. Installing an individual skill directory copies
only `SKILL.md`. As of the tested Amp CLI, package-relative MCP commands such
as `./bin/bifrost-launcher.mjs` are resolved from the Amp process working
directory, not from the skill directory, so the generated `mcp.json` uses the
launcher search shim instead of a package-relative command.

## Difference From `codex mcp add`

`codex mcp add`, `claude mcp add`, a manual Cursor `mcp.json` entry, or
`amp mcp add` registers one MCP server directly in a user's host configuration.
This plugin packages a safer default server shape behind host plugin flows
where available, so users can install or remove Bifrost without hand-editing
MCP configuration. Amp uses the generated skill bundle documented above, with a
skill-local `mcp.json` rather than a host plugin manifest.

The MCP process created by this plugin is independent from the VS Code language
server process. They may point at the same `bifrost` binary, but each host
starts its own stdio process.
