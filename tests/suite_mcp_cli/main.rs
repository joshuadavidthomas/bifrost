//! Consolidated `suite_mcp_cli` test harness.
//!
//! Each module below was previously its own `tests/*.rs` integration binary.
//! They were merged so the suite links the library once instead of once per
//! file; module scoping keeps every test path and helper name isolated.
//! Run a single former file with:
//!     cargo test --test suite_mcp_cli -- <module>::
