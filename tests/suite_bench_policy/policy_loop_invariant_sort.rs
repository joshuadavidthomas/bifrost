//! The loop-invariance rule prototype (#1474, Milestone 6).
//!
//! Motivation, from the issue's own corpus: running the built-in
//! `bifrost.code-smells` pack against this repository produced 284 findings
//! with a 100% false-positive rate, and roughly 250 of them reduce to one
//! missing predicate -- is the value operated on inside this loop declared
//! inside or outside the loop body? The in-loop rules ask only "is this call
//! written inside a loop", which every one of those findings answered yes to
//! and none of them should have.
//!
//! `tests/fixtures/policies/loop-invariant-receiver.rqlp` asks the real
//! question, and this module is the evidence that it separates the true
//! positive from every dominant false-positive family in that corpus, for all
//! five claimed languages (#1598 graduated the prototype's proof from Rust to
//! Rust, Python, Java, TypeScript, and JavaScript). The rule is *still* not in
//! the built-in pack, but no longer for proof reasons: workspace-scale
//! assertion evaluation exhausts the pipeline row budget on this repository
//! and took a 68-minute release-build pack run, so promotion waits on that
//! capability. The rule header records the numbers.
//!
//! Each near-miss must be clean for the right reason, so every test asserts the
//! run's completion before its findings.
