# Bifrost patch provenance

This directory is derived from the official `tree-sitter/tree-sitter-scala`
release `v0.25.1`, commit
`a067c39163b62b19e76cea17476f3188da8c9e51`. The upstream MIT license
remains in `LICENSE`.

Bifrost carries two declarative grammar fixes that are not available together
in a published crate:

1. Issue #1073 declares a generalized-LR conflict between
   `extension_definition` and `_soft_identifier`, then adds `"extension"` to
   `_soft_identifier`. This preserves Scala 3 extension definitions while
   allowing valid Scala 2 expressions such as `extension == "json"`.
2. Issue #1016 applies upstream commit
   `6f9d7bc93ee153719d0d785e63e0fc77d333dad7`. Its
   `_constructor_annotation` rule limits an annotation to at most one
   immediately adjacent argument list, so a following list is parsed as the
   class constructor. Upstream generated-parser commit
   `a68000002745b94eec61cef741efe7cede4ff465` is the immutable reference for
   that fix.

The generated files under `src/` were produced from the checked-in
`grammar.js` with `tree-sitter-cli 0.25.9`.

To regenerate, work from this directory and run:

    npx --yes tree-sitter-cli@0.25.9 generate

Then run the focused acceptance tests from the repository root:

    cargo test --test scala_extension_soft_keyword_test
    cargo test --test scala_analyzer_test issue_1016_scala_annotated_constructor_whitespace_forms_keep_parameters_and_bodies
    cargo test --test mcp_property_fuzzer issue_1016_i1_accepts_annotated_constructor_jobctrl_scala_fixture
    cargo test --test searchtools_definition_selectors issue_1016_scala_annotated_constructor_supports_sources_and_body_reference_context
